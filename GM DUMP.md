## Q: Are there Demons? Angles? Devils? Celestials?

A: There are Demon Lords that inhabit **[[Abythras]]**; several of them have traveled to Kanyiirah, their malevolent Arcane influence having been felt thoroughly in the Western [[Idanthi]] continents.
The Titan [[Caelaistra]] was herself (or her spirit, at least) pulled from the celestial realm of radiance called [[Lämmrus|Lusturil]], a place visited oft by the Mothers of Kanyiirah but little more is known about it. In truth, Lusturil is the sphere **[[Lämmrus]]**, home of the #celestial spirits that manifest only rarely upon its harsh surface {like the Jinn of the Arabian desert} This is the home of [[Aethmi-Istar]], [[Valencia]] after her murder, the #Ilystrin, and those [[Vaal'k]] that remain devout to their holy father and once-divine mother.

The [[Passions & Apathies]] of Kanyiirah play an important role in how these exospherals (extraspheric/multispheric visitors) interact with the world. For instance, the 'angels' and 'devils' of this world are beings of a shared heritage from **[[Lämmrus]]** called the **Ilystrin Celestials** {and not unlike the Eredar (Draenei) of WoW, the devils are a fallen faction of Ilystrin mystics called the [[Drakhaën|Narithalë]]}. 

Coming to Kanyiirah and having these unique [[SECRETS#True Laws of True Magic|liminal]] god-born presences playing ruthlessly with their emotional sensitivities; presences that native Kanyiirans have essentially bathed in every day since birth. Pure Ilystrins would be quite anathematic to the influence of the Apathies, while the [[Drakhaën]] would be driven mad by the engorging stench of the Passions. [[Daemons|Daemon Lords]] also abhor both, but have learned to shroud themselves in Arcane wards to stave off the lingering presences of both auras.

Also too, all Ilystrin would be drawn to follow the Lämmrus-born children of Aethmi-Istar and Valencia - the **[[Vaal'k|Vaal'korr]]** sons and **[[Vaal'k|Vaal'kuhrea]]** daughters: the celestial demigods that have no true place in the world and wander between the realms. Both Divine and Primordial sources touched their souls at birth and by the [[Laws of True Magic|Second Law of True Magic]] that governed their creation, the Vaal'korr are [[SECRETS#True Laws of True Magic|Instinctual]] beings and as such they are barely affected by the Passions and Apathies, unshackled from their influence and free to follow each's own desires upon the Kanyiiran Sphere. Many are monastic in this way, using their divine gifts to step between the boundaries between spheres often and observe the history of the system as it unfolds. Among the Idanthi, several have sired the Aens'hel, the light-touched descendants that bear a glimmer of their radiant parentage. The Vaal'kuhrea on the other hand are Instinctual beings, capable of great physical feats and charming the weaker-willed of the mortal races; many are great generals, guardians, or just brutal killers. They are quick to fanaticism, grasping tight to whatever gives them identity and remaining unburdened by any higher sense of morality.  

_Is there a connection between the Daemons of Savuirn and the Celestials of Lämmrus?_ No. They are separate beings with altogether different biologies.  
Within the larger realm, the term “demon” encompasses all fiends, since Daemon Lord influences are the most heavy-handed. The laymen of Kanyiirah might refer to “demons” in a broad sense having no understanding of the real differences between the fiendish Tiefling species that were present at [[Nashtara]], the malevolent Daemon Lords of Saviurn, and the truth of the nightmarish spirits that are the fallen [[Drakhaën]]. 
It won't be until later, when the [[War In Heaven]] has introduced true [[Shaedriël|Devils]] to the [[Muérai|Underworld]] — or to the Abyssal moon of [[Abythras#Ghaal|Ghaal]] — that the distinction between fiends enters the languages of the other worlds. A pit fiend might be interpreted by Kanyiiran mortals as one of the Underworld’s countless demonic denizens. 

In general, the Underworld will simply be believed to hold all fiends; the Vólat Chruch preaches that the realm of Muérai is the place where all the incarnate wickedness of mortal kind resides, shuffled off the waking minds.



## Q: How old is the world?

A: Old. The [[Family of the Endless]] were at work for hundreds if not thousands of years before [[Nashtara]], as they do not natively perceive time in the same linear fashion as mortal-kind. The [[Idanthi]] arrived only a few hundred years before then as well. 
Some clues of this will have to be discovered out in the rest of the world: for instance the crater impacts of {TBD} will contain meteorite shards of [[Yggrāhkærn|Olession's Lash]]. Additional details regarding the other [[Yggrāhkærn#Colossi|Colossi]] Titan-spawn encountered by the Idanthi will also hint to this ancient history.

During the time of the first few campaigns though, the 'known' world will be quite young: 
the earliest canonical one-shot will have the players helping [[Darkness|Vespera]] originally seal The Widow, [[Fate|Asteria]], into the heart of the planet, thereby breaking true prophecy and severely limiting divination magic, freeing Kanyiirah from the grip of predetermined destiny but unintentionally bringed all cosmic eyes to bear onto the little oceanic spere.
Other early one-shots might also have the [[Kanirûl Pantheon]] still walking amongst the Cara-Dönian people.

The world beyond the sacred isles of Cara-Dön, however, ages on. The human Idanthi nations rise and fall, straining against the burdens of great mythic beasts (the [[Leviathans|abyssal children]] of Umbravex), the [[Colossi]] of [[Yggrāhkærn]], the forces of the [[Daemons|Daemon Lords]], the mighty fallen [[Drakhaën]], and those of their own kin that pursued — and found — the purest darkness offered by the Apathies.

By the time the first proper campaign kicks off, [[the Thinning]] will have occurred and the nations of [[Cara-Dön]] will have drawn their borders, satisfied to share in a tenuous existence while the [[Eternal Maelstrom|Mists of Dolos]] and boundary oceans hem them in, by their own gods' design. Likely set in 97 SD.

### Other Places
Other continents or islands of Kanyiirah might house more majestic creatures like Medusa, Minotaurs, harpy, cyclops, or variant dragonoids called wyverns…

# Character Seed 
(Could even fit NPCs)
The last war of the Thinning was the least bloody, thank gods. Though it was resolved with the least number of corpses made, it made up for it in the ceding of the most territory, military assets, holy relics, and as is customary, the warding of noble children to the victors houses...

# Fae Known
The presence of the titular, stereotypical Fae is a role that needs to be played... maybe one that visits Cara-Dön after the Era of Walking gods? One or two ambassadors from Echni that are looking to follow after their royals only to hear of the Departure and see the turmoil of the Thinning wars. Other family members would be interesting, maybe a brother to Solanas or a sister of Tympestre

Echni = Earth-Mars
Echnican/Echnic = Earthling/Terran-Martian
Fae/Faerie = Human


# Dark Elves
Its only natural for me to find a place for a Drow-like lineage in my world. The easiest answer is to bring Drow directly in, as a variant of the Elvi that arrived at Nashtara, capable of speaking the same language as them but eschewing the suhnlight for the shaded caverns and eventually the halls of the Frostfire Peaks. 

Alternatively... They could inhabit [[Moons#Valya|Valya]]. Tied to [[Lunatas]] and perhaps even her Departure... Elvi that are tied to her in some way, by blood or by faith. Her departure might have drained them of her light, leaving them husks of who they were meant to be?

Edit: [[Elvi#Nox'eli]]

# Cultish Record
An immortal, or long-lived individual, takes a liking to a particular people group, perhaps the kobolds or Kitsune, and tasks themselves with evolving their way of life. By teaching them diverse languages, sanitation and cooking techniques, philosophy, and the benefits of certain breeding traditions, this leader could raise a new variant of the species up to the level of more advanced races. Over several hundreds of years of course.


# Power Distribution
The [[House Taran|Tarani Houses]] have a technological hold on cutting edge firearm manufacturing that provides the dukes with all the power they need to command obedience within their domain.

Similarly within the [[Carain Empire]], their allyship of the [[Vólat Church]] provided their collection of [[Aethmi-Istar#Artifacts|Istarian holy relics]] held by the Tsar and distributed to the Imperial diocese(???)

## Wealth
The wealthy use gifts and donations, art and music to drive home their points, to leverage their power and lord it over others that hold wealth… power moves are much more subtle sometimes than moving armies on a battlefield

# Veterans
of the 9 Thinning wars can be found all over the isles. Though few remain from before the 4th war; the bloodiest engagements being fought by the Urik and Nagaji legions

# Shreds of Chaos
Chaos was itself one of the [[Family of the Endless|Endless]], but... it was [[Vault#Details|fractured]] and sent its power into the far corners of the cosmos.

One such mote of untethered chaos became a book called *Apocalypse*, responsible for the creation of powerful artifacts and curses. It is not fully itself, only recently having acquired a Spirit to act as a facade of sentience, it hides its nature as a piece of true Chaos, formed as an object to hide from Entropy of the Endless.

# Technology… 
Includes pivotal inventions, like the printing press. Just scrolls and large, handwritten tomes for now, in the isles? Something as big as the printing press would change nations, induce wars, and much more, across the Idanthi world at least.

The Idanthi will be broken up along their regional borders, with some that boom in industry progressing further in technology than others that are under cruel rule or indentured servitude

- More metals/coatings for weapons??

## Generations
I’m forgetting a key factor in the generational thing…. [[The Thinning]]. A long period of on-again off-again wars that would have brought the overwhelming population of the sacred isels during the time of the gods much lower, especially among the First and Second children. Out of necessity, there would be a younger batch of generations coming out of this time into the period of the [[Vólat Church#Schism|Vólatian schism]]

# [[House Taran|Tarani Houses]]
sea forts!!

## police
are well equipped with flashbangs, poison and smoke grenades, and knowledge of the streets. They place ranged guards on high ground with soft resin ammunitions and train grunts to grapple and shackle in pairs of two as often as possible

- - -
## Classism
Pedigree, class, and caste hierarchy are found all throughout modern-day Cara-Dön, due in large part to the Vólat Church's distribution of divine arts to noble bloodlines, and the affluence of the Tiefling dukes of the [[House Taran|Tarani Houses]]. The worst of these cases however are primarily found in Ropesh. There, even access to basic education — while readily available to most citizens of even the smaller towns — is relegated to those of a certain social class or only as a requirement for pursuing certain careers. 

Enrolment at locations of higher education like the [[University Towards Enlightened Truth|UTET]] have suffered at the hand of this silent prejudice as well. Even as each individual has their role, ambition, aspirations, and delusions of grandeur are not for the weak-minded. Those in power must control the spread of information for the safety of society as a whole, lest misinformation spread unchecked.  "An ordinary person lacking the proper qualifications for attaining higher knowledge simply has no need for it."

### Their own riots...
The thing about violence see is that they have a lot more to lose than we do. Violence disrupts the extractive economy. Their entire system… is high-strung and vulnerable to shocks because they’ve made it thus. Because the rapacious greed of capitalism is punishing. But if the system is so fragile, why do we so easily accept the situation? The problem is that we’re always living like we’ve lost. We see their power, their [wealth]… and we think it’s already over for us. We don’t stop to consider how even the playing field actually might be. Violence shows them how much we’re willing to give up. Violence is the only language they understand, because their system of extraction is inherently violent. Violence shocks the system, and because the system cannot cannibalize itself and survive, the hands of Power are tied, unable to raze that from which it profits.
But that’s precisely the devil‘s trick. That’s how colonialism works. It convinces us that the fallout from resistance is entirely our fault, that the immoral choice is resistance itself rather than the circumstances that demanded it.

# Coinage
pp, gp, sp, cp, ep

The key is to treat each nation’s currency as a “brand” with fluctuating value based on geopolitics, craftsmanship prestige, or even magical potency. Below’s how to blend standardization with cultural uniqueness:


Core Concept: Minted Identity  

Each nation/guild/family mints coins with distinct names, materials, and designs, but all fit into the standardized tiers (PP/GP/SP/CP/EP) for simplicity. Merchants and banks *convert* them based on trust in the issuer’s reputation.  
Example:  
- Crownsteel (GP) from the militaristic nation of Houses Tahan might be worth 1.5× its face value in cities that rel on Tarani armies for protection.  
- The same Crownsteel (GP) could be discounted to 0.75× value in the Carain Empire that views the Houses Tahan as a threat, forcing PCs to seek money-changers or use local currency.  

System Setup  
 1. Standardized Abbreviations  

Keep the classic abbreviations but assign them culture-specific names:  
| Abbreviation | Generic Term | Example Nation-Specific Names |  
|-------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------|  
| PP (Platinum)     | Sovereign’s Tier | Dawnshards (sun-worshipers) / Grave-Crowns (necrocracy) |  
| GP (Gold)         | Nobility Tier | Crownsteel (kingdom) / Forgemarks (dwarven guilds) |  
| EP (Electrum)     | Guild Tier | Charter Chits (merchant leagues) / Songsteel (bardic colleges) |  
| SP (Silver)       | Commoner Tier | Hearthiron (families) / Pearlsparks (coastal traders) |  
| CP (Copper)       | Peasant Tier | Gravepennies (death cults) / Embercoins (volcanic clans) |  

2. Value Fluctuations  
- Trade Commissions: A neutral Coinwrights’ Consortium sets baseline exchange rates (1 GP = 1 GP), but adds fees for “foreign” coins.  
- Merchant Freedom: A tavernkeeper in Nation A might refuse Nation B**’s coins entirely, or a black market dealer could offer 2× value for embargoed **Dwarven Forgemarks (GP).  
- Craftsmanship Bonus: Exquisitely minted coins (e.g., elven Starbits [SP]) might hold +10% value for artisans who melt them down for material.  

3. National Examples  

| Nation                     | GP Name      | Design                                    | Value Quirks                                                             |     |
| -------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --- |
| Ironhold (Dwarven)         | Forgemarks   | Anvil stamped in glow-ore                 | Worth 2× GP in mountain realms (they’re magma-forged and never tarnish). |     |
| Sylvannis (Elven)          | Starbits     | Crescent moon with embedded star sapphire | Accepted at face value *only* under moonlight; -50% in daylight.         |     |
| Varkesh (Militaristic)     | Crownsteel   | Sword-pierced crown                       | +25% value when purchasing weapons/armor; -25% in pacifist nations.      |     |
| The Gravefold (Necropolis) | Grave-Crowns | Skull with ruby eyes                      | Cursed if stolen; can be “sacrificed” to undead merchants for discounts. |     |

Mechanics for Players  
- Coin Conversion Checks: A Charisma (Persuasion) roll to haggle exchange rates.  
- Political Carryover: A PC with Ironhold Forgemarks (GP) gains advantage on Charisma checks with dwarven smiths but suspicion in elven courts.  
- Quest Hooks:  
  - The party must transport uncut Starbits (raw SP) to an elven mint to avoid depreciation.  
  - A dying king’s Grave-Crowns (PP) lose value as his political influence fades; PCs race to spend them.  


 Why This Works  
- Familiar Framework: Players still track “GP,” but immersion comes from *which* GP they’re holding.  
- Worldbuilding Depth: Nations feel distinct, and players care about *where* they earn/spend loot.  
- Plot Flexibility: A bank run on Hearthiron (SP) could trigger a rebellion, or a counterfeit Songsteel (EP) scheme might pit guilds against each other.  


Optional Rule: Coin Abbreviations  
If you want to keep *both* classic abbreviations and in-world names, use a hybrid:  
- GP (Crownsteel), SP (Hearthiron), etc.  
- Track weight/value as normal, but roleplay the coins as cultural artifacts.

# Weapons
## **Vyre-Shael, the Singing Glaive**

| Core Form             | 6–7 ft ash-wood staff tipped with a crescent of **Auralite**, a living crystal that vibrates in sympathy with thought.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| _Signature Effect_    | The blade “sings” at different pitches when swung or spun; those frequencies can shatter stone, steady allies’ nerves, or mask troop movements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| _Customization Lanes_ | - **Runic Lattice**: Warriors burn personal sigils into the wooden haft; the glyph-pattern modulates the weapon’s tone and tactical role (e.g., lower bass notes for earth-rending, bright treble for illusion).  <br>- **Shard Inlays**: Fragments of Infinity socketed along the blade’s inner curve let masters **fold** the glaive down to a short spear or unfold it to a full guandao-like war banner. |
| _Cultural Symbolism_  | The sweeping crescent recalls the great red moon **Roida**; to foes abroad, any distant keening on the wind is a warning that “the Roida-Reapers” have arrived.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Valyara Crescent Disc

| **Silhouette**             | A **slender open-ring blade**—imagine a razor-edged moon sliver, 50 cm across, with a counterweighted grip at the inner curve’s midpoint. Worn flat at the hip or across the back, it reads as a stylised icon of **Roida and Valya** entwined.                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *Core Trick*               | Throw it and the disc rides its own curving gravity eddy, trailing twin violet-and-crimson arcs. A spoken **Word-of-Return** snaps the disc back along a mirrored path—enemies see two after-images and misjudge which is real.                                                                 |
| *Battle Modes              | _Close-in_ (reverse-grip sickle) • _Return-Throw_ (chakram-style) • _Moon-Lock_ (dock two discs mouth-to-mouth to forge an impromptu **double-crescent pole-scythe**).                                                                                                                          |
| Custom Paths               | _Edge alloys_—star-iron for anti-mage shearing, leviathan-tooth for bleed. • _Voidline inlay_ along the spine lets Draktharun suffuse dragon-fire before release. • _Lunagraph etching_ records its owner’s major battles in tiny crater-dots; master smiths read the dots like constellations. |
| *Why It Screams Kanyiirah* | Marries the binary-sky aesthetic (twin moons/twin suns) with the islanders’ obsession for tools that double as art; foreigners call its looping flight “the halo of death that always comes home.”                                                                                              |



# Good Talk
1) You're comments on the two Alseid cultures is accurate; the Erdö clan does reside on Dön and is culturally distinct from their cousins across the channel, though their biology is identical. This highlights a main struggle of mine, trying to decide what is more narratively impactful for the stories I want to tell: 

do I focus more on magical variants that then shape cultures, like the distinctions between Nox'eli Elvi and Ganzi Elvi? (more on them later...) This would fit the more traditional approach to fantasy world building and allows me a great amount of creative liberty and magical hand-waving where I might need it. 

OR 

do I force shared biology and focus more on the social and cultural differences brought on by shifting religions, wars, and factions like real-life history? I feel like the later is greatly missing in fantastical fiction stories, likely due to the difficulty in sitting down to determine how a people group might still be varied when they are surrounded by other fantastical lineages that are so distinct from them. I mean, that right there can help explain why there is no clear distinction between the three spiritually-focused lineages you called out; their lineage has little to do with the explanation of their culture, that's just how these groups typically are described. But in character focused narratives like a TTRPG or a novel, individuals of any lineage can express themselves through the lenses of any of the backgrounds and societies found in the diverse menagerie of the Sacred Cara-Dönian isles. 

2) Nagaji were one of the harder hit groups that suffered during the wars of the Thinning, therefore they are more scattered and usually fall into tribes alongside the more dominate Alseid clans ("Naagri" was a legacy name for Nagaji that I had missed changing, please always assume the Nagaji spelling from now on).

3) Evryn's landscape is structured very similarly to the Gleamwood, so any lineages that could thrive there are most likely to already be settled in the East side of Dön

4) The [[Elvi#Ganzi|Ganzi]] do admittedly need more work. A small blurb I had scribbled down was "The Elvi that are touched by reincarnation: the process is done through the submergence into a certain river in Cara, perhaps one blessed by Solanas or another of the Kanirûl to be a bridge to the lesser Spirits of Kanyiirah." Recall, Solanas and the Kanirûl are themselves mortals recently accessed by the immortal powers of godhood they stole, but they were themselves simply Fey lords and ladies from Echni. It was their own hubris that led them to introduce the Elvi to the process of reincarnation via the Spirits. I am working on some vignettes that explain how and why they acted as they did, from the eyes of Lunatas. But in-world lore and history as penned by their worshippers, would look VERY different from reality. That is why you might find some disconnects; note these down as potential kernels of thought that the in-world religions might try to find answers or justifications for. That is very realistic to real-world history. #reincarnated

```reincarnated
Okay, so, so I'm imagining how I can make this Lord of mysteries plot somewhat, if I'm gonna steal from it and rip it apart and I'm gonna put it in canoeing, right? So essentially, the plot, from what I can gather so far, and a story that I think would be very cool, is if one of the endless has a an event occur, or maybe it's just spontaneous. Maybe this natural. Maybe it's the interaction between the entropy of fate and or the the Nico, the endless of fate and the endless of of life. Whenever Yuri Khan was was broken, there was a conversation between those two, and they said, maybe we could recreate the universal origin. Maybe we could recreate the harmonious chord that was struck at the universal origin and start our own potential another, another cycle of life, anyway, regardless, something along those lines. Or maybe interaction with with fracture, or maybe an interaction with with resonance, any, any one of those different things, whatever that new entity is, whatever that new personality of the endless is, it would interact and have power still greater than any of the gods, any of the Ascended any any who bear a mote of infinity. It still would have that power, but it would be new, it would be curious, and it probably wouldn't overly communicate so very much, like the gray fog over or the mysteries it could manifest a place or a dream, like state or something along those lines, to protect its chosen someone that is bonded to or with or is interacting with as a way of curiosity is lended its power momentarily to experiment or experience life from a different perspective, whatever it would be, it is the vessel that protects this curious mortal. This curious mortal stumbles into the realm of another endless somehow finds a fracture of something, taps into it, or attunes to something, or digs a little too deep, and the might of that endless, the power, just absolutely ravages the mind or destroys, or seeks to or almost eradicates the safe haven, to the point where suddenly the gray fog must rush in and protect again, but like it has intent, right? Like up until now, Klein has thought, this is a safe place. This is a dream like state. I'm untouchable here. This is a separate reality of my mind, and I can somewhat control this gray fog, this, this extra power that's been lent to me, but he has no idea that is intent, that it has its own agenda, or that it needs to employ attention and and persistence of of state of mind in order to be present with him, to protect him. Right? The endless exist across all space and time, but their intention and their attention very similar to the shards of edelism from, I think that's italism. Donald ism from the Cosmere, the intent of a God, the the attention of a God, is really where you manifest the personality most, mostly, even though they technically are everywhere, there has a certain limitation for character building, personification of this deity that requires attention and requires I guess focus is really the best word, attentive, focus. And if the gray fog, if it had its attention probably somewhere else or it wasn't looking very closely, the lens power doesn't necessarily trigger always. It's the it's the threat to the sanctity, to the sanctuary, a threat to the safe haven that draws the attention and where it needs to rush back in. I just think that's so cool, the idea of having a chosen who's kind of just on the on the on the experience track, on the on the roller coaster, with this new entity, this new personification of the endless, this new personality of the endless. I just find that so, so so cool, because the again, you could really drip feed it for a character development, the the power, the the the the new personification may not even know how to communicate yet. It may be very young, or it may be very naive, or it's just experimenting, and it may not know that it has the power of creation, right? It may not know that it has such power of the endless. It may just think one or two other things. But then, as as the experimentation of the chosen sort of occurs, that's when it starts. To become more aware of what it can do. Maybe it seems to interact with the other endless, any, any one of those things. Maybe a personification of its own, another, another version of itself could be potentially part of the conversation. I don't know. There's so much character building we can do there. I don't know if I want like seniority, but something along the lines of like the older the original would have a lot more control over their abilities to manifest. Maybe they don't have as many personalities. Something along those lines, because fracturing is is a big part of how Mozart infinity are distilled and distributed. One could say that a whole moat of infinity, one that has not gone undergone any fracture at all, would be the most powerful, and that would have been Myst. Myst was the only one in current lore that did not have any other personifications or personalities, she simply was and existed at the planet's core, essentially, maybe not even that. Maybe she just, she just chose acne as the place to manifest. But still, she did not choose to fracture. She did not undergo any, any of the fracturing to split her personalities as the others did, there's at least one additional, there's there's at least two personalities with every single one of the endless except mist. Mist did fracture eventually, because of her seal and or she chose Luna task to be her inheritor. True Name true names her as as her inheritor, power transferred to Luna test. And then mist also set up a contingency that Luna tests could not hold all of it. And then it fractured and went into the her companions. And thus the Carnegie was born. The Carnegie Rao are intentionally meant to be some of the most powerful gods in existence. Again, they may not know exactly how to tap into it, and it will require the presence of Luna test in order for all of them to to to experience it. So Luna test is like the catalyst that allows the others to truly manifest their full power of their fracture of infinity. So, yeah, I'm just thread of infinity. Maybe is the better better word, mote of infinity is the true whole. And then threads of infinity are what get distributed down. I might have different tiers of that as well to understand, like how far down from a single moat, from a whole moat. One is, but theoretically other, other than the presence of Luna test acting as a catalyst, the Cali Ral are one step away from from true Godhood, from and from endless category, from from endless status, because Myst was one of the original endless so they are, they are chaos incarnate. And thus, the longer they hold their thread of infinity, the more personal that thread becomes to them. The chaos of Myst, almost, sort of adopts the personality of the one that holds it. So I genuinely do think the passing or the theft or the fracturing of Mists note of infinity is probably going to be the largest catalyst for a Kenyon, or not a canoe, but a cardonian timeline storyline. I do want there to be some more play with Titans and Giants and the ascended. This the status of becoming ascended, if, if the Ascended status is just a spiritual upgrade or spiritual change, or if ascension truly does require a small threat of an affinity. I think it would. I think I like that keyword being that way, and then maybe we change slightly the wordage between ascending from from a lesser spirit to a greater spirit. I still think that process less to greater is still a spiritual change, but ascended, the key, the key term of ascended, the key title of ascendant, is one who is, has undergone the spiritual transformation to a greater spirit, and also has has captured or been been instilled with a shred or a thread of Infinity. I don't know. We're just going off here. We're just, we're just vibing, also the domain of one of the endless, at least a safe haven or the spot, but they would take meetings in dreams, whatever that looks like. It would be a throne room. I. So the throne rooms, position and location and demeanor and decoration and architecture, and particularly the throne itself, would give massive clues as to whose realm this was, or whose whose home this was. Each throne would be very unique to the endless that sits upon it. And when they so choose, if they so choose, the endless can conjoin their almost mental domains to manifest as a single room, a single room of many thrones, all sitting in a circle, maybe not many thrones, but several thrones. I do think each personification would have its own throne. Each each, each personality and the creation or the existence of a new throne being added to the mix, if there was no communication over who that was, would be wildly cool if entropy or if missed, not missed, but if entropy were to actually missed. Why didn't I think of that if a, if a one of the endless was fractured, if missed, if missed throne remained empty, no Miss throne would just remain empty. There wouldn't be creation of a new mist throne. Uh, well, maybe. Well, we can play with it. We can play with it. But it'd be really interesting if a new personality was, quote, unquote, born or fractured, and anybody, any of the endless that would be around to witness it, like, witness the thrones move and make room. I see, that'd be so cool. Like, yes, these gods are gods, and they basically control all of reality. But I just love that, that little hint that there are some things that exist, there are some systems in place, like the personification of these thrones, the conjoining of the thrones that are just sort of systems of reality, maybe put in place by chaos from the very beginning to help guide his children, or, I don't know, just something, something that would like bring them together, like that concept of paternal direction, but it's also mysterious, and it wasn't like blatantly laid out. And there's still some things that they can explore and like discover, even as endless, even as gods. I think that'd be very, very cool. And maybe that's too high. Maybe, Maybe instead, we just say anybody who bears the moat of infinity could also go there. And perhaps there are lesser thrones, or lesser chairs around the thrones as like advisors. So if a character somehow were like encounter or absorb, the tiniest, middle, minuscule shred of a previous mode of infinity have been fractured many, many times. I'm thinking like, God, I forget her name now, but the the vampire, the mother of vampires, something along those lines, like it's just so diluted, but still technically, does tie you to the inheritance, maybe, maybe not the stolen side. But if, if somehow, there had been a way for it wouldn't, it wouldn't be vampires, because the whole curse is the fact that it's stolen inheritance. But some someone of the kind of girl, if they were to name an inheritor, maybe not even intending, maybe not even knowing the magic of the power of primordial naming. But if they just did naturally and they tried to die, the power would be vested into an inheritor, whether that be of the bloodline of themselves, or whether that would be of chosen something along those lines. But like, imagine being gated from, from witnessing this, this realm of Thrones, becoming in or coming into the inheritance as a character, and they're just sort of stumbling upon this, just stumbling upon the throne room, seeing the unique architecture of each throne, trying to understand how they all interact with each other, maybe even witnessing the movements of in a dream like state, the movements other servants of the endless they wouldn't necessarily be Celestials, but others that maybe bear fractions, fractures, fractured modes. I don't know it would be very common. The image I have in my head is just very, very cool, like an empty hall or an empty, circular, domed room where a character just wandering between these giant thrones, trying to understand, like, where they are and what purpose they serve, like what entity they belong to. But it would be empty, like they wouldn't witness it, because, because that kind of meeting, the meeting that would occur at that conjoined space, basically never happens anymore, honestly, probably since, since missed fractured, they haven't had one, or maybe they've only had one since then, that would just that would be very cool, because then the birth of a new one, completely separated from a different character, maybe a character, or maybe it's the same character, right? They've inherited a certain shred of an entity who probably have to be missed, unless I made up another one that had gotten fractured. But it would make more sense if it was maybe like one of the personalities that I already have is fractured. Maybe Steria. No, that's not a Syria. But the the other version, the eagle, carne, version of Assyria, endless of fate on you go to Karn. Maybe that one fractured and went into one of the giants, and then the Giants blood that came to that could be something maybe, maybe, maybe I don't know, we'll play with it, but just that idea of like a conjoined space, that'd be very cool. I'll just add another one. So we're talking about reincarnation of Elven souls, very similar to how they actually are originally laid out. I think in Forgotten Realms lore, there aren't enough bodies. There's too many souls. But the thing is, it's not all elves can sort of host it. I think in Forgotten Realms, it's literally just Elves don't have many kids, so there's just fewer elven vessels to take on elven souls, and all the Elven souls essentially get recycled with this. It's with with kenoya. It's more only a certain bloodline, only a certain blessed biological family, or biological descendants of the first that were blessed actually have the ability to play vessel for elven souls. So you've got multiple elven lines and lineages, all right, I suppose variant lineages, the souls that exist, this the body, the the mind and the soul. Because, again, I'm mostly talking about soul here, because soul in Kenya, real also carries memory, spirit. Is the power and the will. The personality belongs to the soul. I still for elven reincarnation of these. This particular variant, the form is not impervious, but but Hardy, quite hardy, and can survive quite a bit, all it would take, but, but the link between spirit and form is is weak, at least, even even even for reincarnated the only way could play into like what we're seeing here with Mr. Ezek from Lord of mysteries, is if the Elven soul was inseparable from the reincarnated vessel. This you if you could somehow do that and break the cycle for that individual form, that person would be immortal. That person would essentially be the most tortured mortal in existence, because their spirit and soul could not be separated from their form, and their form was blessed by a god for whatever reason, if they when they die, they just wake back up for whatever reason they don't. Their form is not accepting any new elven souls. It's just that soul, just that mind or bound to that body, that would be a curse, that would be a curse of one of the reincarnated elvens. That would be wild because you would die. You would experience death, horrible, painful, natural death, and then the cycle would glitch, and you would essentially just wake back up with a with a healed vessel. It wouldn't necessarily have to be right away. We could have a little bit of time of unconsciousness while the vessel heals itself. Maybe it has a sort of stasis that it goes into, but the form, the form is, is God like in that state, the form is quote, unquote, immoral. I mean, we could, we could say that the form only gains at. Mortality and impervious. Is impervious to damage and is immutable when there is no spirit bound to it, when the spirit and form link is broken, the form just goes through a mending cycle and is impervious and is and is completely like perfect in that state, and then it just, it just is operable now for a new soul to be bound to it. And by the blessing of Solanas, maybe he tapped into his, his most upper divine repertoire for this one. This this blessing. But essentially, the power of Solanus, the existence of the mote of infinity of mist that gave him that power just perpetually binds new souls and new spirits to that form. That's that's how the reincarnation of the Elven of that particular el Varian elven line would work again, for this individual character, they're talking about more of like this cursed immortal. They would perfectly fit into that mold. And just the cycle of getting a new soul is broken. They just are cursed to always remain in a cyclical, binding death, maybe not even death, because again, maybe, maybe death. I don't know. It would be more interesting if the person had died multiple times but just keeps coming back to life, they would be more tortured. A more tortured individual, they would be probably more likely to to not advertise their abilities and basically to just suffer in silence, because they just don't want to die. They don't want to go through it again. The most gruesome thing for that would be to die, very much like the heralds of the Cosmere I'm now reminding myself, they go to braise, but are essentially fixed, and it's their mind that just constantly is shattered. They're broken. And that was that is essentially what happened to this character, an elven reincarnated cursed to always have the same soul would essentially be a herald. I didn't even think about that. That's 100% about that, but that's 100% what it would be. Or to take it even another different step further, you could say it's the soul, or the spirit in the form are the ones that are bound together. So whoever comes in this for regular reincarnation, regular elven reincarnation is it's just the soul. That way you inherit the form and the power. If somehow that entity had had a very powerful, potent spirit before you, you essentially like take on that, that essence and power, but it's your personality. So again, I need to redefine a little bit more the difference between spirit and soul, but intent and will and forward focus is supposed to be spirit. Power is spirit. And mental faculty, memory and personality are soul. So your mental faculty, your personality, your motivations, your fears, all of that is now. Again, you're granted a new body, and you are now inheriting the power of this individual. Again, you are still mortal unless you unless there was a vessel out there that somehow had gained a power of longer life. Now that doesn't make any sense. We'd have to limit what that would that would look like. I um, but then again, maybe we could make it even more tortured, like one. One of this bloodline decides that they want to pursue God like powers, and they they acquire this incredibly powerful spirit. And have all this power, but miss something, something crucial in their in their magic or in their pursuit, and it becomes unattainable for them whatever they're going after, whether it's immortality or immense power. They cannot tap into it unless they die, and they are of the Elven reincarnated bloodline. So they know it won't be them that comes back to inherit the blessing, slash curse. So they go through all of this for for selfish reasons. Because they quote, unquote, die, that soul leaves is unbound, and a new soul comes in and inherits the immortality. Now that new soul is 100% cursed to just be unable to die, but again, it goes back to the vessel and the spirit now being accessible by this soul, and this soul has to just exist. They would have their own personality, their own their own motivations and morality, but they would essentially be unkillable. They would be God like and they didn't ask for it. And if they were of a demeanor, or of a of a, I guess demeanor is probably the best way, if they're an individual who is is kind or is unmotivated by power, that would be miserable. That would be, that would be so awful, because they would be unable to die. They've inherited this incredibly selfish power that they never even wanted, that is in itself an undying curse to where, when they when they do die, their soul does not pass on the new a new soul does not come in because of what was pursued, so maybe they would be trying and searching for a way to end whatever it is the soul before them did to bind the spirit or to bind the soul in this crazy way, so they could go on an entire mission, or entire their whole life's goal was to break the cycle so that this immortal power is no longer existing, and they could re enter the natural cycle of sending this power somewhere else.

5) Strix are meant to be incredibly varied in appearance, often carrying distinct markings unique to the individual and have a unique ability to selectively pass on genetic traits to their offspring. Also, it is not uncommon for a single Strix to have multiple romantic partners in their short lifespan, allowing for large swings of visual distinction amongst even close family members. Size and musculature are the main traits that cannot be influenced and is the main way Strix culture draws its–albiet thin–boundries 

6) The Thinning was the socio-economic reaction to the vacuum of power and leadership left by the sudden Departure of the Kanirûl pantheon. There were many Urik families at the beginning of the Thinning, which posed the greatest threat to the other factions that arose. They were targeted early and had nearly their entire race eradicated out of fear of their power and position. 

The Kitsune were also thinned to near-extinction, though for different reasons: they were seen as favored by the Spirits of Kanyiirah and were powerful spellcasters. They were recruited and used by their Elvi commanders and leaders as conduits of magic on the battlefield, which also made them primary targets. 

Ghoran were never overly numerous to begin with, mostly keeping to themselves in the Gleamwood even when the gods walked the isles. They were viewed as favored by the Kanirûl, since many of their lineage had been invited to live amongst the gods at the seat of their power in the condorium of Ech'Yinara.

7) Primarily, Hobgoblins groups settle alongside Oread dwarves, most notably, but can also be found in the mesas of Cara and Dön. They are the most militaristic and fill many of the rank-and-file of mercenary companies and large-faction militias. Their variant Goblin lineages are scattered to the four winds of Cara-Dön, and can be found just about everywhere, though they thrive alongside Smallfolk and in large cities.

some hair brained scholars would believe the Suhns are inhabited, either by the Kanirûl or their ancestors

## Oaths of the layman
A certain quirk of the Ropeshian culture is that each member of the society takes an oath to uphold their responsibilities for the town. The baker swears to bake to a certain standard, captain of the guard swears to keep his men fit and capable of defending the town, the judge swears to execute the spirit of the law, the blacksmith swears to mend and upkeep the tools of the townspeople to the highest craftmanship, the priest swears to council with truth and seek the favor of the gods, etc.
