  - spawn of Umbravex

The corrupted spawn of the TitanÂ [[Umbravex]]. As varied as the creatures of the sea, the Leviathan are the colossal undersea beings that were touched by the twisting [[Wyrd]] wielded by the Titan, unable to control their strange evolutions but bound to the consuming will of the Titan, nonetheless.

Though the original Leviathan may not have been directly born children of the strange crustacean, they were awakened to a powerful inheritance by its intent and corrupting touch. They abide in the deepest, darkest caverns and trenches that lie at the bottom of the oceans. From their bloodlines came the sea serpents and marine aberrations that feed near the surface, as well as the greatest of monstrosities that roam the [[Evryn]] wilds.
