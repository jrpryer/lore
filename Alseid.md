Alseid hooves rumble across both the vast Tashi river plains of central [[Cara]], and the peace-filled glades of the Gleamwood in western [[Dön]]. Blending humanoid and equine features, some scholars opine that Alseid were the original inspiration for the tactical superiority of cavalry. These four-legged folk voice no opposition in the matter, provided these scholars remain silent regarding the contentious Alseid suitability to replace draft animals…
Alseid have antlers growing from their foreheads that grow very slowly, branching every 10 years for the first century of life (so an Alseid with six points per antler should be between 60 and 70 years old). Only a few rare Alseid elders have developed a larger collection of points beyond twelve.

In Cara, most Alseid can be found roaming the lowland river plains between Ropesh and the Empire, moving in a large, [[Tashi|nomadic clan]] under the protective vigil of their Khans. These Alseid often approach their life with a might-makes-right principle, having no qualms with overpowering others and taking their land and chattel. Despite this belief, they have a sense of deep loyalty and honor, never stealing from their friends and family and sharing the spoils of any hunt with the clan.

While most Alseid spend the majority of their lives with their clan, young Alseid — upon reaching maturity — will commonly enjoy a stint of what is euphemistically called their “wild years”. During this time, small Alseid cohorts will band together and work through their seasonal aggression and immaturity. If they survive this, Alseid tame their wilder impulses and return to their clan, while others that find solace in the freedom will hearken to the call of adventure.

In contrast, the Dönian Alseid of the Gleamwood prefer to pursue art and music while they preserve the culture and stories of the [[Kanirûl Pantheon|Kanirûl]] in their peaceful realm. The [[Erdö]] clan holds a more diverse collection of sacred isle lineages and maintains the presence and power of the Primordial fonts of the ‘Wood. They share close bonds with the Elvi and Nagaji they share glades and tents with. #REVIEW   

"{Dönian} Alseid are graceful woodland cousins to centaurs, blending humanoid torsos with the lower bodies of nimble deer. Because they rarely venture far from their wooded glades, some call them “grove nymphs,” although they’re more closely related to humanoids than fey.
"Alseid innately feel a close connection to the natural world and often feel a disconnect
between themselves and creatures who dwell in more urban areas. They typically feel uncomfortable in large cities where their hooves tread the cobblestone streets
and relaxed in the wilderness where they can feel the earth beneath them."



# Traits
Your Alseid character has certain hereditary traits dictated by their lineage:
**Age**. Alseid reach maturity by the age of 20. They can live beyond 100 years %%up to 500 years%%.
**Size**. Your size is Medium. Alseid stand over 6 feet tall and weigh around 200-300 pounds.
**Speed**. Your base walking speed is 40 feet.
**Heightened Senses**. You have advantage on Perception checks that rely on sight or hearing. You can see through lightly obscured areas normally and areas of dim light as if it were bright light.
