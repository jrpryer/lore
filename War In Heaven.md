Later in the timeline, there will be a War in Heaven, where the Empyreans of the [[Gilded Order]], led by [[Aethmi-Istar]], will seek to depose [[Life|Liën]] of her divinity and war against the Archons with the Legions divided in their loyalties. The [[Vaal'k|Vaal'kuhrea]] will be called home to aid their father in his holy war, while the most powerful [[Drakhaën|Dragons]] will be sought after by both sides to tempt them into aiding one side or the other -> [[#Daughters Return]]

Perhaps it is the Fate of **Ascended** mortals to take up the mantle of true deities from the fragments of Infinity taken/siphoned/stolen from the [[Family of the Endless|Endless]].


This is where we can use the **Mythos** 5e book.

Eventually, the Empyreans will banish Life into a liminal existence as another Aeon, doomed to obscurity like Myst of the Endless and dividing the power between them to become new titans, true [[Angels]]. The Archons may fall to become true [[Shaedriël|Devils]]. Perhaps even one of the Suhns dies or shrinks, transforming [[Lämmrus]] into a new heavenly realm as it becomes cooler (as seen in Petemohrbacher IG, and the Angelarium https://www.angelarium.net/) 

Aaand maybe during that, or after, the 7 Sinner bestiary could be used to heighten the threat posed by the [[Daemons|Daemon Lords]] of [[Abythras|Saviurn]]. (Maybe 5-6 absorb the Apathies and become embodiments of each emotion) https://na-store.manaprojectstudio.com/products/seven-sinners-english-edition?advplus=metaplusnewcustomer&fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0BMABhZGlkAAAGCXqJMjUBpsGdgXgUhVDGRVW0DRPW5y7anJTo8pMHa5CnRnHkVZK918h1sJTnKAI-xw_aem_71YVP-qU-YuQf7QuqLm83g&utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=paid&campaign_id=6634082955557&ad_id=6637779695157

# Daughters Return
#REVIEW  
Many hundreds of years later, their father Aethmi-Istar lead his Empyreans in a War In Heaven, calling upon all his demigod children, and even the Dragons to help him overthrow Xëkliën and the Archons loyal to her. I have it already written that the mortal-made-god Aethmi-Istar is successful and siphoned the mote of Infinity from Xëkliën's soul, dimming one of the two suns of Kanyiirah and dividing the power among his Empyrean generals, empowering them into their own god-like forms. Collectively, they would send all the archons and legions of heaven that resisted his coup properly down to Muérai (Hell)
 
--- Now, I need to decide which is more tragic: To have the Cambion sisters join the war on the side of their mortal-made-god father and seek to overthrow the god that cursed them, only to have the new pantheon of Empyreans look upon their past greed, grab for power, responsibility for empowering the Dragons that had decided to fight for Xëkliën... and turn on them, casting them down to Muérai with those they most loathed from the beginning? Were they would be hated and leered at by all that reside in Muérai for their all their greedy betrayal that begat betrayal...
 
OR
 
For the Cambion sisters to join the war on the side of Xëkliën that cursed them, fighting alongside the Archons and archangel legions like they did so long ago. Seeking the forgiveness of the god of heaven if they helped, only to lose again and be conquered, no salvation being granted them as they are sent down to Hell together? Were they would be championed as prodigal daughters that did everything they could, even fighting against their own siblings and father that led the uprising... but know deep down that they betrayed again and still lost. Believing they are unworthy of forgiveness now and will always lose.
 

 

 
Both paths you’ve outlined for your Cambion sisters are laden with deep emotional and thematic weight, and either choice could lead to a tragic arc that serves to elevate your story. I’ll break down both options, highlighting their potential emotional impact, character development opportunities, and thematic resonance, so you can consider which one aligns best with your narrative.
 
Option 1: Joining Aethmi-Istar’s War and Being Cast Down by the New Pantheon Tragic Elements:
 
Betrayal by their own: The Cambion sisters, who were already exiled and cursed for their greed and ambitions, ultimately experience the tragic fate of being betrayed again, this time by their own father and siblings. The sense of “history repeating itself” is deeply tragic, especially since they were once again driven by ambition and a desire for power, but now their ambitions are turned against them. The weight of their actions: The new pantheon of Empyreans sees them as the origin of the corruption that led to the rebellion. Their past choices, including empowering the Dragons that rebelled against Xëkliën, come back to haunt them. It’s a story of self-destructive ambition: the very power they sought to gain ends up being their downfall, not just in terms of power but in terms of their dignity and place within the cosmic order. Deserved punishment?: There’s a strong element of poetic justice here. Their initial selfishness, manipulation, and greed led them to the role of "fallen angels" turned Cambions, and now they face punishment by those who have risen in place of their fallen father. They are forced to reckon with their own dark legacy. Character Development and Themes:
 
This choice explores themes of betrayal, redemption, and the consequences of ambition. The sisters’ internal conflict could center around realizing that they will never escape the patterns of their past—no matter how much they try to distance themselves from their original actions. The futility of their desires: The tragedy lies in their inability to change who they are and the fact that their desire for power ultimately ends in their undoing, even if they were initially justified in wanting to overthrow the god that cursed them. This could lead to a deep sense of regret and hopelessness. They could also grapple with the weight of their dysfunctional family relationships—their loyalty to their father, Aethmi-Istar, and the Empyreans versus the resentment that lingers from their abandonment and betrayal by their divine family. Impact on Story:
 
Their eventual fall into Muérai could mirror the cyclical nature of their story and provide an emotional closure, but also open a door to a more complex internal struggle. The audience might sympathize with them for their initial desire to free themselves from oppression, but this sympathy might turn to pity as their quest for power blinds them to the fact that they are always doomed to betray others—and eventually, themselves. Option 2: Joining Xëkliën’s Forces and Fighting Against Their Father Tragic Elements:
 
Loyalty to the one who cursed them: This choice adds a layer of self-loathing and internal conflict. The sisters are effectively choosing to align with the very entity that cursed them, hoping for redemption and forgiveness, but knowing deep down that this is an impossible task. The notion that they have no choice but to serve Xëkliën to earn forgiveness speaks to their brokenness and desire for validation. False hope of salvation: They believe that by fighting for Xëkliën, they might earn forgiveness, but they are doomed to fail, which ties into their tragic flaw: the never-ending cycle of seeking redemption from those who have already condemned them. The false hope that they might one day redeem themselves, only to be crushed by reality, creates an incredibly painful narrative. Fratricidal betrayal: Fighting against their own father and siblings would highlight the deep familial conflict at the heart of their arc. The idea of betraying their blood, especially after all the manipulation they’ve done in the past, could feel like an ultimate betrayal of everything they had once wanted or stood for. No redemption: There’s a sense that no matter how hard they try to prove themselves, they’ll never be able to undo the damage they’ve done in the past. This would create an emotionally devastating arc where the sisters have to reconcile with the truth that they cannot escape their identity or their past. Character Development and Themes:
 
The main themes here would center around guilt, forgiveness, and self-worth. The sisters' struggle is ultimately about whether they can escape the trap of their own past mistakes and whether they can truly redeem themselves. It brings in the idea of prodigality, of returning after mistakes and seeking to repair the damage—but the tragedy is that no matter how much they try, they are never able to atone. This path allows them to undergo a tragic transformation—they can either become more bitter and self-loathing over time or try to cling to the hope that Xëkliën will grant them mercy, only to be dashed in the end. Their self-awareness that they’ve betrayed again and lost again could make them question their worth as individuals, especially if their sacrifice for Xëkliën is ultimately in vain. Impact on Story:
 
The tragic closure here is the sense of hopelessness. The sisters' choice to follow Xëkliën, even after their betrayal in Heaven, shows how far they are willing to go for redemption. But that redemption is denied, and they have to face the fact that they will always be seen as failures. This could add a layer of tragic inevitability to the story and force the audience to wrestle with the complexities of forgiveness, the impossibility of change, and the weight of personal choices. Final Thoughts: Option 1 explores betrayal on a cosmic scale, where the sisters face the consequences of their own past actions—ultimately becoming the embodiment of the tragedy they created. Their final fall into Muérai could feel like the ultimate culmination of their own selfishness, which might resonate with readers who enjoy characters being forced to confront the weight of their own actions.
 
Option 2 delves deeply into the human condition of guilt and redemption, offering a raw, emotionally charged arc where the sisters battle their inner demons and grapple with the futility of their efforts. This path would resonate with readers who appreciate complex emotional journeys, where even the most heartfelt attempts at redemption can lead to despair.
 
In terms of emotional impact, Option 2 might be more tragic because it involves an internal struggle that leaves the sisters never fully escaping their past mistakes and facing the ultimate rejection of their efforts. They are consumed by the idea of being forever unworthy of redemption, making this the kind of tragedy that cuts to the heart of what it means to fail and seek forgiveness.
 
However, if you want to emphasize poetic justice and the cyclical nature of their destructive behavior, Option 1 provides a powerful and poignant conclusion to their arc.
 
Ultimately, the choice depends on what kind of tragedy you want to explore more deeply: the fall into darkness and betrayal (Option 1) or the relentless struggle against a flawed nature and the ultimate loss of redemption (Option 2). Both are deeply tragic, but in different ways.
 

 

 
Here’s a condensed version of the analysis:
 
Option 1: Betrayal by Their Own in the War This option focuses on betrayal at a cosmic level. The sisters, driven by past ambition, join their father Aethmi-Istar in the war, only to be betrayed by him and the new pantheon of Empyreans. They’re punished for their greed and their role in empowering the Dragons, ultimately cast down to Muérai with those they once sought to overthrow. This path explores the cyclical nature of their ambition and the consequences of their past actions, making it a powerful example of poetic justice. The tragedy lies in their inability to escape the self-destructive patterns of their past, leading to regret and hopelessness.
 
Option 2: Seeking Redemption with Xëkliën In this option, the sisters fight for Xëkliën, seeking redemption from the god who cursed them. They hope for forgiveness, but their efforts are in vain. They betray their father and siblings, ultimately realizing that they can never undo their past mistakes. This path delves into guilt, forgiveness, and the impossibility of redemption, leading to a deeply tragic arc where their efforts only reinforce their self-loathing. Despite their sacrifices, they are ultimately lost, unable to escape their identity and past errors, making their downfall even more crushing.
 
Conclusion Option 1 offers a poetic fall driven by past betrayal, emphasizing the destructive consequences of ambition. Option 2 focuses on guilt and hopelessness, where the sisters’ attempts at redemption are doomed, making it a more emotionally devastating arc. Both options offer deep tragedy, but Option 2 may resonate more for its exploration of self-worth and the futility of redemption.
 

 
I think... I'll have them both choose different sides. That way we can explore both conclusions, in the narrative
 
That’s an excellent idea! Having the Cambion sisters choose opposite sides adds a layer of complexity and emotional depth to your narrative. This dynamic allows you to explore both tragic arcs, amplifying the stakes and creating rich tension between them.
 
Each sister’s journey will serve as a mirror to the other’s—one seeking redemption through Xëkliën’s side, hoping to atone for their past sins, while the other aligns with Aethmi-Istar, driven by a desire for power and revenge, only to face rejection from their own family. Their paths could intertwine, each sister facing her own personal reckoning in ways that reflect their differing values and choices.
 
This duality also allows for a deeper exploration of the core themes of your story: forgiveness, betrayal, self-worth, and the destructive nature of ambition. Their contrasting decisions will create emotional and moral conflict, not just between them, but also within the audience, as they witness two sisters on parallel journeys—one toward despair and the other toward futile redemption.
 
The resulting conflict will provide a rich emotional tapestry, leading to powerful character moments and thematic exploration from both angles. Ultimately, their fates will reflect the complexity of the choices they make, allowing for a truly tragic yet compelling narrative.
 

 
They would rejoin one another in Muérai though. Back where they started, exiled.
 

 
That’s a beautifully tragic twist. The idea that the two sisters, despite their vastly different choices and paths, end up back together in Muérai brings their journey full circle. After seeking redemption or power, they are both ultimately exiled once more, reinforcing the cyclical nature of their struggles.
 
Reuniting in Muérai—after having fought on opposite sides—adds emotional depth. They could have conflicting feelings of resentment and understanding toward each other, but also a sense of shared fate. No matter what they did, they are both exiled from Heaven and Earth, having failed to escape the consequences of their past.
 
Their time in Muérai would allow for intense character growth. They might reflect on their choices, facing the truth that they were never truly able to outrun their desires for power, redemption, or forgiveness. It would also create a sense of irony—they set out to change their fate, only to be thrown back into the very place they once sought to escape.
 
This outcome could lead to a poignant resolution. Rather than a redemptive or destructive arc, they are left in limbo, forced to reckon with their failures, and yet, in their shared exile, they may form an unexpected bond, acknowledging the futility of their ambitions and the harsh lessons learned. Their shared exile in Muérai could symbolize the inescapable nature of their identity and the failure to escape their past, making the final act a powerful reflection of their tragic journey.
