# Lost Children
The [[Kanirûl Pantheon|Kanirûl]] are, in a sense, just discarded children, granted power by a greater force of Will, but not given direction or instruction on how to employ it properly. The oldest and farthest-gone realize that they were molded by a creator that cruelly rejected its creations, trapped within the medium of this smaller world and unable to ever rise into the realm of the [[Family of the Endless]].

Their names are hidden — their [[Primordial Mastery - True Naming|True Names]], from before their immortal days:
- ceolRoid - The ninth High King of the Greater Echnican Court of Amber Dusk, called [[Solanas]]
- fralValya - The last disciple of Myst and wife to the High King of Greater Echnica called [[Lunatas]]
- kiulTaya - Daughter of the royal blacksmith of the Amber Dusk court, called [[Pyronia]]
- duelPar - A shrewd military general of Greather Echnica that led many Court of Amber Dusk victories, called [[Borealis]]
- ailYala - A lowborn seamstress who found herself in the home of kings within the mightiest court of Greater Echnica, called [[Valencia]]
- zeolRak - The Master of Coin for the Greater Echnican Court of Amber Dusk, called [[Tympestyr]]
- uolPer - A southern region king of Greater Echnica and subordinate to the liege lord of the Amber Dusk court, called [[Taerannon]] 


## Lunatas' Truth
The [[Kanirûl Pantheon|Echnicans]] were at first elated at the concept of wielding their new power. Under the leadership of their High King, the Kanirûl sought to build the ideal world, one better than the world they believed they had lost. It was only Lunatas that knew the truth: that they had escaped the consequences of their sins by a hair's breadth in Great Echnica, sealing away [[Family of the Endless|Myst]] at the expense of their own World Tree and were being imbued by her mote of Infinity as punishment. It is this tampering of the Echnicans memories that stunts their full use of Myst's envelope of power. 
{ See [[The Burning of Dèndronaos]] in Vignettes for more }

But now that they had traversed the Spheres, they had simply traded in one member of the Endless for _four_. Lunatas confided in her husband as best she dared, careful to articulate her fears and the danger posed by the [[Titans]] and implored that he share a healthy fear of the Anarûl as they built their kingdoms. She had to be careful not to let too much truth slip, lest her own magic be undone and his memory be again scarred with the full knowledge and weight of their dark past.

As the inheritor of a greater allotment of Myst's power, Lunatas was titled the One True Divine in Myst's final breaths, with full knowledge of what the Kanirûl's possession of the mote of Infinity could do. Though she props up her husband as the leader and strength of the pantheon, it is her knowledge and grasp of Mysteries that hold their world together. Consequently, it is her loss at [[the Departure]] that has shrouded the truth of the past in so much obscurity.

# The 5th Family
Vampyrs are despised in [[Ropeshian Dynasty|Ropesh]] for good reason; the 5th family of [[Fate of the Heartkindler|Rathus]]' line held the throne of Ropesh during [[the Thinning]] and was exiled from the nation for abuse of power and practicing of their dark magics. Since then, the family has continued their experimentations quietly on the fringes of the Carain Empire, performing [[Wyrd]] [[Wyrd Mastery - Blood|blood magic]] rituals and experimenting with the blending of bloodlines. They have not yet succeeded in creating new pure Vampyrs of other lineages, however they are responsible for: 
- Inventing and releasing the infectious disease of Lycanthropy along the [[Vólatian Theocracy|Vólatian]] border, having crafted it from the corpse of a [[Shurgen-Tur]]
- Birthing the [[Hags]] of the Silver Hills, and later perfecting the experiments to produce their fanatical loyal Blood Witches

> [!recite|bg-c-blue] "The teachings of my father stated simply that as Vampyrs, we had to drink to survive. That feeding off the blood of the living was the only way for us to go on, animated and thriving our long lives. However, early in my studies, I deduced there was a hidden true truth to our family curse. You see, blood is the currency of the Soul, the vessel of life: the medium by which life is transferred from Soul to Spirit to Form... And to consume blood is to take the essence of another Soul into ones self. It is the embodiment of gain by loss; the delicious irony. The bliss of acquiescence... of surrender. It is ruin, made flesh. So, I began my work. No longer satisfied with the sating of that ever-present hunger, I instead turned myself into a monster. I consumed the lives of the living, draining each of my meals completely of their life force. With patience and tenacity, I soon felt a new reserve of power within me, made available to call upon at my whim.

> [!recite|bg-c-blue] "Think on it, child. How long have I really been alive? How many thousands have I slain in my time on this sphere? How many lost souls are contained within me? I drank from the veins of godkin, fed on hearts torn from the carcasses of [[Draktharun|children of the Drakhaën]]. For a time, I was the Duchess Freya's consort and lieutenant of northern Dön. My own battalions were my livestock; loyal subjects to a man. Call me a Daemon, name me your Dévalkar: it matters not. Nothing will change your fate this day. You stand in the presence of a [[Wyrd Mastery - Blood|Blood]] god, and I will paint my halls crimson with your sanguine innards." 

# Wandering Bloodlines
Under the charm of [[Life|Rhajos]], several of the [[Drakhaën]] intermingled with the [[Yggrāhkærn|Colossi]] of the southern continents to bear the infamous 12 half-dragon children that now rule those nations. Later, these 12 half-dragon giants would sire the mighty [[Draktharun]] race, through their Idanthi servants.



# Demons? Angles? Devils? Celestials? 
Yes. [[Daemons]], [[Vaal'k]], [[Shaedriël]], and [[Lämmrus|Ilystrin]], respectively. 
The Daemonic [[Daemons#Cyndralis|Cyndralis]] and [[Daemons#Draezhir|Draezhir]] societies are calculating and patient, willing to wait years to achieve their visions. And though both know themselves to be above the lesser races of Kanyiirah... the Daemon Lords are not capable of believing anyone can be stronger than themselves.

Q: _Is there a connection between the Daemons of Savuirn and the Celestials of Lämmrus?_ No. They are separate beings with altogether different biologies.

Within the larger realm, the term “demon” encompasses all fiends, since [[Daemons|Daemon Lord]] influences are the most heavy-handed. The laymen of Kanyiirah might refer to “demons” in a broad sense having no understanding of the real differences between the fiendish [[Cara-Dön#Cara-Dönian People|Tiefling]] species that were present at [[Nashtara]], the malevolent [[Daemons]] of [[Abythras|Saviurn]], and the truth of the nightmarish spirits that are the fallen [[Drakhaën]]. 

- [o] It won't be until later, when the [[War In Heaven]] has introduced true Devils to the Underworld that the distinction between fiends enters the languages of the Sphere. 

A pit fiend might be interpreted by Kanyiiran mortals as one of the [[Muérai|Underworld]]’s countless demonic denizens. In general, the [[Muérai|Underworld]] will simply be believed to hold all fiends; the [[Vólat Church]] preaches that the Beyond is located within [[Hræth]] and is the place where all the incarnate wickedness of mortal kind resides, shuffled off the waking minds.


# True [[Laws of True Magic]]
The only way to bend this process of magical Convergence is through the application of each core source's Mastery discipline. The landing source of a Convergence can be:‌

- Arbitrarily anchored by a collection of Arcane [[Arcane Mastery - Words of Power|Words of Power]] in the most powerful spellweaving
- Rewritten by commanding the Primordial [[Primordial Mastery - True Naming|True Name]] of the target(s)
- Bound to the form of an entirely different source by Divine [[Divine Mastery - Spirit Linking|Spirit Linking]], or
- Cursed/empowered to obey all rules and laws of a chosen source by the Wyrd power over [[Wyrd Mastery - Blood|Blood]]

Each mastery takes great sacrifice to achieve and each comes with its own set of drawbacks and consequences upon use.
