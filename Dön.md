(dJUNE / dJEWn / dʒuːn)

The warmer, occasionally arid, landscape of the central isle of the [[Cara-Dön|Cara-Dönian]] continent.

Home to the most highly populated cities on its northern and eastern coasts, as well as the most diverse natural ecosystem in all of the sacred isles on its western banks, Dön sits at the center of the political, natural, and magical powers of the region — and the land bears the scars of past struggles that have waged over control of each.

# Inhabitants
Those that populate the central major isle consist of three main people groups, denoted by the region they occupy:

Eastern Dönians are ingenuitive, militaristic, and feudal, populating the mighty nation of the [[House Taran|Tarani Houses]].
Central Dönians are exploratory — and sometimes hermitic — survivalists. They wonder the arid desert at the center of Dön and live the mesa highlands along the central northern coast. 
Western Dönians are attuned, peaceful protectors of the Gleamwood, represented almost exclusively by members of the [[Erdö]] clan.

The dominating eastern presence of [[House Taran]] contains the largest population of lineages within the sacred isles, bosting the highest count of [[Tieflings]] in their central cities, along with high numbers of Gnome [[Smallfolk]] and [[Elvi]], followed by smaller minorities of [[Oread]], and [[Hobgoblin]] populations.

On the western coast lie the vast forests of Dönian lumberyards. These are carefully cared for by the [[Erdö|Erdö clan]] that consists of several groups of rotating leadership. Chief among them are the great [[Alseid]] families, as well as [[Elvi]] of the Wood, and protective [[Nagaji]]%% , and reclusive [[Ghoran]] %%. Additionally, a group of [[Aqualii#Shae’thalis|Shae’thalis Aqualii]] and a small handful of [[Hobgoblin#Wildings|Hobgoblin Wildings]] are also known to have settled the northern edges of the forests.

In the northern center of the isle lies the coastal bastion of [[Pahlássia]], the mighty city state of industry and exports. Though they are quite selective on who they allow to settle within their walls, the city sports a motley assortment of lineages, including a high percentage of [[Smallfolk]], [[Oread]], and [[Urik]]. [[Hobgoblins]] are also known to find easy employment here as well.
