Seated in the grand temple city of [[Argentum]], Sanctum of Light, the Vólat Church was originally established to guide the worship of the **Vólaril**, the combined pantheon of Kanyiiran gods, outlining the accepted traditions and rituals to be proffered to each sect:  

**[[Anarûl Pantheon]]** - The oldest known beings that influenced all sentient life that either formed or arrived within the domains of the [[Cara-Dön|sacred isles]]. Their early presence informed the original doctrine of the Vólat Church who encouraged devotees to commit themselves to unity and experience all facets of the condition of life. 

**[[Kanirûl Pantheon]]** - Deities that arose after the world was created. Some speculate that after [[Solanas]] and [[Lunatas]] found Kanyiirah, the rest of the pantheon were enticed by the beauty of the new world and arrived at different times from their seats of power in the first world {called Greater Echnica}. Their commitment to keeping the order of things balanced and moderating between the many forces that push and pull the world is an ideal all those of the Vólat church strive to embody.
- As time went on, the gods of the Middle Pantheon chose to bless certain lineages and imbue them with power, colloquially called 'divine arts'. Members of these original family lines hold a great amount of authority in the Theocracy.

At their founding, the church was a means of drawing upon the power and will of the Upper Pantheon in an existential form, while offering supplication to and follow the teaching of those of the Middle Pantheon in an immediate form. Together with the Kanirûl, the Anarûl were combined into the overall **Vólaril** (VOH-lar-ill) as worshiped by the original Vólat church.

# laws
in the horrors and strife of [[the Thinning]], the limitations and rules around healing magic would have been strained to their limits. At first, the devout of the Vólat Church were hesitant to heal in the name of the Kanirûl gods, lest they be supporting true evildoers on one side of a conflict versus another. Then, when they were not smote by [[Tympestyr]]'s lightning nor scorched with [[Solanas]]' divine flames, they pushed the limitations of divine healing magics as far as they could.

The working theory was that the success of stitching a Spirit back to its Form was stringent upon on two things: the time since death (separation of Spirit from Form), and the amount of teaching on the nature and lessons of the Kanirûl the individual priest performing the ritual healing had received.
	This would later be tested in controlled monastic studies and found to be a less than exact science, since individual priests could have varying grasps of the teachings and — interestingly enough — varying degrees of faith, which seemed to be a hidden third factor. Thus, the ability to successfully perform a sanctified revivification ritual became a drastic leg-up to any chaplain looking to rise in the order the Vólation leadership.

Laws around revivifications became more and more strict as the wars of the Thinning passed into history, as more practitioners of other [[doctrines]] — namely the [[#Kilkesh Riots|Vólat-sin]] heresy that sought the direct interdiction of the Father [[Life|Rhajos]] himself — were capable of performing the rites without Church sanctifications.
- Sanctifications were rules that kept priests from revivifying murders, rapists, or monsters of the Complex, and limiting the revivifications of beasts to 1 each year, as well as providing a principle for petitioning another priest to perform the rites should one priest's personal interests conflict over the revivification of certain persons.

# Schism
> 97 SD

The founding doctrine of the church has however been recently rewritten after certain secrets came to light on the nature of the [[Anarûl Pantheon]] and their original arrival to the sphere. Disagreements on the acceptance of this new insight caused a dangerous schism to form amongst the devout. It was one particular governess who speculated that the loss of the Kanirûl was due to a final mandate from the Anarûl Pantheon to their [[Titans]]; an order to wipe the slate clean...

It began with the controversial publishing of a treatise penned by then-governess [[#Pontifex|Oriana Jhin]]. Questions began to arise as many people realized the implications of her research. For Oriana had investigated the Eternal Maelstrom as close as her ship dared, and through her observations had speculated that the abandonment of the Kanirûl Pantheon may have actually been a tactical retreat from a confrontation with the Titan servants of the Upper Anarûl Pantheon. The Titans were believed to have been placed upon the Sphere to enact the will of the Anarûl, but their recorded actions throughout history were questionable and few and far between, making it unclear if they acted on their own or upon the implicit command of their deific patrons. And so Oriana speculated thus: that the Anarûl were in truth inconsistent, fickle, and apathetic, having chosen a coldness to the world of Kanyiirah with no regard to the lives of those that lived upon the sphere. She concluded that the loss of the Middle Kanirûl Pantheon was due to a bloody final battle between them and the Anarûl's mythical Titans.

Articles were published quickly, spreading alternate theories and possible corrections that needed to be made to the Vólat doctrine to eradicate the Anarûl Pantheon from all supplication or honorifics. However, many bishops of the Vólatian [[Vólatian Theocracy#Centenary|Centenary]] did not act swiftly enough, unsure if such drastic action would draw the ire of those primordial deities that had been near-silent for so many years. Their hesitancy was soon met with outright demands from their congregation and many of their own clergy. This caused the church leadership to panic and call in the [[Vólatian Theocracy#Pulette Knights|Pulette Knights]] to restore order.

## Kilkesh Riots
Yeklov Kilkesh — a battle master who had come to the Theocracy to retire and serve his fellow man — took up the sword after witnessing a brutal first strike from the Pulette Knights. His leadership lit a proverbial powder keg amongst the distraught people in a movement that came to be known as the **Kilkesh Riots** as a mob of common people and clergy demanded a reform was required to reestablish the moral legitimacy of the Vólat Church. The riots lasted for 4 days, culminating in the seizure of the Sanctum of Light, [[Argentum]], and the rewriting of 3 out of the 7 founding Vólatian decrees. #REVIEW 

These new ratifications were presided over by the new High Priestess Oriana and outlined a clearer doctrine of the Vólat traditions, defining a new **Vólat-rah** approach to venerate the Kanirûl solely. Her parish outlawed the old acts of worship to the Anarûl — as well as any reverence given to their deific associations, like the Passions, Apathies, etc. — and made heavy alterations to the sermonic readings of [[Aethmi-Istar|Holy Aesuhir]]'s Book of Thorns that heavily featured those themes, banning it all under the new label of **Volat-sin** heresy.

Those who no longer found themselves in favor with the views of the new Vólat-rah doctrine dispersed and suffused much of their old Vólat-sin customs and rituals into the corners of the world, hiding them in local traditions and superstitions (namely in Delipol and the Evryn wilds).

## Current
Worship of the [[Anarûl Pantheon]] is still heavily frowned upon outside of the Theocracy as the new orthodoxy spreads, but with the current attentions of the [[Vólatian Theocracy#Inquisitorium|Inquisitorium]] focused inward, the Chassurates have become very lax in their follow-through against outside practitioners. To aid the layman's understanding of the new orthodoxy, the Church doubled down on teaching the importance of living a life devoted to the Kanirûl teachings, akin to that of Holy Aesuhir, primarily following the tenets of [[Solanas]] and [[Lunatas]]. They heavily edited the Book of Thorns to feature Aesuhir before he was found by the Mother Asteria, guiding the text to reflect their own goals and reducing the appearance of the Anarûl to a single line.
  
Though the current state of the Kanirûl is technically unknown since [[The Departure]], the Vólat Church holds to the belief that [[Solanas|The Dawnfather]] and [[Lunatas|Dreamweaver]] ascended to [[Lämmrus|Lusturil]] and will call their devout faithful to them into that celestial realm where they will govern as the new Mother and Father of an Ascended people.

And so it follows, that those of the Vólat-sin who seek to know the [[Anarûl Pantheon|Anarûl]], find meaning in the fingerprints of the physical world, and live at peace with their inborn nature rise in fervent opposition to the suffocating Vólat-rah demands of striving for spiritual perfection, changing one's nature to reflect the teachings of the Kanirûl, and rationalizing order into a disordered world.

### The Inquisition
Oriana Jhin has allowed the [[Vólatian Theocracy#Inquisitorium|Inquisitorium]] too much power to root out the Vólat-sin heresy and now struggles to restrain them. The common folk live in fear of black-masked inquisitors poking through their homes and places of business.

### Excursion to Evryn
A charismatic bishop of the Benedictiary named Jorel speaks openly of taking their reform to the Shurgen-tur Dominion, now that the old edicts of the Middle Pantheon no longer stand.
