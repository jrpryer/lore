# Asteria 
- The Widow, Mother of the Stars, keeper of the [[Anarûl Pantheon#Foresight|Foresight Rune]] | Kanyiirah

The definition of destiny, reverberation, causality, and foresight. It is the pinnacle of cosmic knowledge and interconnectivity. Without it, the truth of what is certain would be hidden, without any hope of peaking into what can or cannot come to pass. Fate governs the endless potential paths of reality. It's domain expands into the multiverse’s infinite permutations, representing every possible future or choice. Avatars often appear as guides, oracles, tethers, or eyes, presenting mortals with crossroads that define their destinies.

# Avæylith
- Ephemeral Reverberance | [[Yggrāhkærn|Olession's Lash]]

Fate of the Endless first manifested itself to the [[Yggrāhkærn#Colossi|Colossi]] of [[Yggrāhkærn]] as an avatar called Avæylith. This avatar was a cherished guide and welcome face to the ruling First Titans of [[Yggrāhkærn]], as they built for themselves a world of perfect balance and resilience. It was their hubris that influenced Avæylith to seek an alliance with [[Life|Xëk'Liën]], the avatar of the [[Life]], to sound once again the harmonious chord that had since faded from the [[Origin|universal Origin]].  ^88bb4b

This would augment Life's own pure note and bring forth a new generation of Endless to be born unto them. Such a feat would have ushered in a new age for the cosmos. Of course, such an act would again lite the fires of chaos to destroy and remake the worlds, erasing all the hard work the existing Endless had already done to the [[Ydi-Kaari System]]. And so Xëk'Liën hesitated, their debate drawing the attention of the [[Family of the Endless|Myst]] as well who, after much consideration, denounced the idea and forbade the alliance.

Not to be dissuaded, Avæylith bade Xëk'Liën come witness the possibilities that could be achieved when the manifested Infinity of the Endless was fully engaged in the future of a single world. However the years had slipped by, gone in a mere eyeblink to the great spanning consciousnesses of the Endless...

Now — with the chief attention of Asteria sealed through [[Family of the Endless#Inversion|Inversion]]'s power and shrouded away by the machinations of the [[Kanirûl Pantheon|Kanirûl]] —  drifts in the wreckage of [[Yggrāhkærn|Olession's Lash]]; the shredded corpse of a sphere ransacked by rampaging Primordial and Wyrd powers, forgotten in the cold vacuum of the Astral Expanse.
