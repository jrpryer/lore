Upon the sphere of [[Kanyiirah]], the continent known as [[Cara-Dön]] is a region of both unity and chaos; a land on the brink of greatness or disaster. 

At a time when the poignant actions of even a meager few can alter the course of history, we find ourselves following the footsteps of **five beleaguered cutthroats**, as they stumble onto the sprawling docks of [[Grayport]], desperate for a hot meal and a bed.


### This is a swashbuckling, treasure-hunting, island-hopping, Pirating adventure on the high seas.

This is a time for praying on rich trade routes, running from heavy military man-o-wars, hunting for cursed buried treasure, and exploring the danger of the wild oceanic tropics. From a modern-day perspective, the technological era this campaign takes place in is around the late 1600's Age of Sail with Renaissance-like technologies of black powder. Read the [world meta](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/kanyiirah-jrpryer/meta) for a more in-depth look.   
  
Make these important selections first, when building your ToV characters:

- Lineage: Choose one of the **Lineages** from the [[Cara-Dön|Cara-Dönian People]] page
	- Note that, if you find another ancestry/lineage with traits/abilities that you really like, still make a selection from the campaign world lineage list as that will be your true appearance. We can then work on what the statistics look like behind the scenes

- Heritage: Select what you think feels thematically appropriate. Anything that would solidify you place in society as a pirate, scallywag, refugee, or dubious merchant is encouraged. Again, if you find something more appealing, let me know and I will assign you a generic Is'Deli Brotherhood pirate gang heritage

- Class: All classes of ToV are available. Some archetypal talents may be granted for free, to lock in the pirate theme

- Weapons: Most firearms are fair game from ToV _and_ VSoS (Renaissance era); the bigger the boom, the more likely you will encounter it in this world


Each of your characters will have certain abilities/equipment granted in the beginning of the campaign. Come in with the following assumptions:
- You are all currently located in [[Grayport]], and bear memberships to the [[Is'Deli Brotherhood]] pirate nation
- 1 rumor and 1 truth that has spread about you. Other player characters will have heard about you and may know one of these

~ Where do you come from? ~
There are eight cultural regions of the Cara-Dönian isles. Choosing which land you hail from determines which races you have access to, what religions you can pick from, and what languages you know. Each region also has its own special trait that you may want to consider before selecting which nation your character hails from:

- [[Erdö]] clans
	- Choosing the Erdö clans as your native culture hub adds +1 Wis stat during character creation. 
	- The lands of the Erdö Clans are by far the least populated region in Dön, filled with small bogs and lush forests. This nation is governed mostly by a confederation of tribes who maintain the balance between themselves and nature, coming together in great times of need. 
	- Religions found here: • [[Doctrines#Kindleheart Concordia|Kindleheart Concordia]] • [[Vólat Church#Kilkesh Riots|Vólat-rah]] • [[Vólat Church#Kilkesh Riots|Vólat-sin]] • Iadizen • Astryan Pantheon
	- Races found [[Dön#Inhabitants|here]]: [[Alseid]], [[Elvi]] (Wood), [[Nagaji]], [[Hobgoblin]] (Wildings), [[Aqualii]] (Shae’thalis)
	- Common Heritages:

- [[House Taran|Tarani Houses]] 
	- Choosing the region of the Houses of Taran as your native land allows you to roll any saving throw at advantage once per long rest.
	- The Tarani are the second largest nation after the [[Carain Empire]]. It is an extremely feudal society ruled by four ruling Dukes, each responsible for governing their own land and laws that vary slightly from duchy to duchy. Their cooperation has often been their greatest strength, opening the nation to some of the most lucrative trade benefits in the known world. The wealth has recently led many to seek war, however, choosing conquest and expansionary goals over the simple increase of wealth accumulation. It has been a few years since their last great war, and it is only a matter of time before they set their sights on their northern neighbors. 
	- Religions found here: • [[Vólat Church#Kilkesh Riots|Vólat-rah]] • [[Doctrines#Thraev'gal Pact|Thraev'gal Pact]] • Zurlism • Segrilade 
	- Races found [[Dön#Inhabitants|here]]: [[Tieflings]], [[Smallfolk]] (Gnome), [[Elvi]] (High), [[Oread]] (Ifrit), [[Hobgoblin]]
	- Common Heritages:

- [[Vólatian Theocracy]]
	- Choosing the Theocracy as your native land grants you expertise in the Persuasion Skill and two extra languages of your choice. 
	- The Theocracy is, outwardly, the most peaceful nation and is often called “The land of influence” by those outside the realm. However, the [[Vólatian Theocracy#Benedictiary|Benedictiary]] is barely holding itself together with much infighting and political strife that has resulted in the creation of the [[Vólatian Theocracy#Inquisitorium|Inquisitorium]]. The recent Vólatian [[Vólat Church#Schism|schism]] has shaken this land and many suspect it will fall into deeper chaos soon. The isle of [[Lesser Isles#Subasa|Subasa]] lies within their borders and is home to the [[University Towards Enlightened Truth]], the premier college campus of the sacred isles, filled with the brightest scholars and their newest technologies. This institution boasts the greatest magical collegiate programs is the known world, where many a spellcaster and [[Mechanist]] has studied and thrived. Many licenses are procured here for practicing Arcane, and even some Wyrd, out in the world, respected by all governments within the sacred isles.

	- Choosing the Carain Empire as your native land adds +1 to your Str. or Con. stat during character creation. 
	- The Empire is a harsh and unforgiving land, ruled by its Tsar monarch from the great Dwarven stronghold of [[Petyrgrad]]. They are the delvers of the richest mines in the isles, producing over 70% of the rare minerals and gems that fill the coffers of the Sunken Bank.

	- Races found [[Cara#Inhabitants|here]]: Elvi (High), [[Smallfolk]] (Halflings), [[Nagaji]]
	- Common Heritages:

- [[Is'Deli Brotherhood]]
	- Choosing the dispersed pirate nation Is'Deli Brotherhood as your native culture grants you the ability to make an additional attack once per combat as a reaction. This combined coalition of the [[Delipol]] and [[Lesser Isles#Isthar|Isthar]] isles is filled with cutthroats, nerdowells, and pirates. Outsiders know little about this nation, though their threat to trade ships and wealthy nobles living easy on the coast is ever-present. Nonetheless, those that do come from this kingdom are always the wiliest, most crafty allies one can make.
