(SAHV-yurn)
(AH-bith-rass)

The home of the [[Daemons|Daemon Lords]] and the great flying cities of their ruling Principes.
**Languages**: [[Abyssal]]

The Daemonic world of Abythras is rife with broken citadels and blighted provinces. The surface of the sphere is suffused in a leaching, heavy, hot gas that leaks from the volcanic poles and whips about the landscape on gusting winds.

The avatar of [[Family of the Endless#Inversion|Khalthon]] dwells at the heart of the world, holding the sphere together and subtly maintaining the Aether well that keeps the swirling laws of rebirth active, constantly transmuting all unbound spirits into new daemonic forms. With such close proximity, many [[Arcane]] and [[Wyrd]] [[Laws of True Magic#Convergence|Convergent]] experiments occur here, primarily by the Daemon Lords of [[Daemons#Lords of Guile|Guile]] and [[Daemons#Lords of Blood|Blood]], respectively.  

The avatar [[Darkness|Thyrrakos]] also hovers about the world, feeding off the chaos the Abythratic Wars churn out. He also fouls all plans of the Daemon Principes and Lords, changing enough variables to force their machinations so that they never quite hit the mark or come to full fruition. 

## Cities
**Tiefratus** (tea-FRAY-tuhs) — A gargantuan city built of volcanic glass and Abyssal iron. Powered by blood from the many bleeding prisoners in its dungeons, the city floats upon dark arcane devices and travels slowly along the battle lines of the Abythratic warfronts.
	The bastion of the Draezhir Daemon Principe of Blood, [[Daemons#Draezhir|Maevelis]].

**Krâmor** _(KRAH-mor)_ – A fortress-city perched atop basalt cliffs, known for its endless black markets.
**Dùrhas** _(DOOR-hahs)_ – A sunken necropolis where forbidden rites are performed in catacombs.
**Malgoth** _(MAHL-goth)_ – An ancient seat of power, rumored to hold the throne of the sole Ash Lord, **Mazikeen**.
**Siravil** _(see-RAH-vil)_ – A lonely spire city rising from a deep valley of red stone, encircled by the deepest of the swirling, sulfurous mists.
**Yunárik** _(yoo-NAH-rik)_ – A cavernous underrealm known for its blood-crystal mines.

# Ghaal
The single moon of Abythras is **Ghaal**, a silvery gray rock of vibrant energies and dense atmosphere of smog.

%% After the [[War in Heaven]], the Archons (or [[Shaedriël]]) may make their way here. %%
