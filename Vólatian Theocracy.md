Located in the southwestern region of Cara, this powerful theocracy serves its people generously, living out Solanas' dream of a unified people with the radiant heart of the [[Vólat Church]] leading it; an institution which recently went under a divisive schism that split governments and relations across much of Cara-Dön. Embroiled in religious fervor, the Theocracy ruthlessly suppresses the old Vólat-sin tradition that is now deemed heretical. The citizens of the Theocracy do, however, live in relative splendor at the seat of art, music, and education. While nobles and clergy of the new Vólat-rah enforce the new rigid orthodoxy, the capital city of [[Virtue]] still shines as a beacon to the rest of the Cara-Dönian people. Dissidents have been forced to flee or face punishment, so the threat of an all-out civil war is no longer hanging over their heads. The Theocracy can now focus on reclaiming much of its former glory from before the [[Vólat Church#Kilkesh Riots|Kilkesh Riots]].

The governing of the populace outside of [[Argentum]] is entrusted to aristocratic lords and ladies who are elevated to regional rule by order of the Vólatian  [[#Centenary]] conciliate. A family's ability to wield divine arts grants them a position of influence and responsibility within the Theocracy, bound by the traditions and teachings of their patron deity of the [[Kanirûl Pantheon|Middle Pantheon]]. These dukes and archdukes rule with the shared interest of growing their influence and wealth under the watchful eyes of their local Church . If an issue with one of these regional lords arises, the Pulette Knights are dispatched to handle the disturbance. If the nature of the disturbance is deemed connected to the use of divine arts, [[#Chassurates]] are then requested to handle the following inquisition and levy any judgment on behalf of the [[#Inquisitorium]] leadership.

The recent unrest has severely slowed the scholarship within the [[University Towards Enlightened Truth]] on the [[Lesser Isles#Subasa|Subasa]] Isle. University scholars had made recent strides in optics, medicine, and alchemy before the schism. 

## History
See [[Vólat Church]]

# Benedictiary
Led by the High Priestess Oriana Jhin, the Benedictiary acts as the executive head of the Theocracy and manages the appointment of Centenary councilmembers. Members of this Conciliate are evangelical, charismatic figures of the populace that seek to both inspire and observe their countrymen in every walk of life.

# Centenary
Ten councilmembers of the [[Vólat Church]] that legislate the workings of the Theocracy, both domestically and abroad. They are the soul of the Theocracy, distributors of the nations wealth and law makers that work closely with the Benedictiary conciliate. 

They are also masters the divine arts of the gods, each having been selected from prominent families within the Theocracy. Each seat is only held for ten years (100 months, exactly) and selections are staggered every month; once every month on the tenth year, one of the seats is always up for reselection.

## Enlightened Council
A small Centenary division of [[University Towards Enlightened Truth|UTET]] alumni and faculty that promote and approve sanctioned dedications for teaching at the University.

## Pulette Knights
The core militia of the Theocracy and police force. They are an organization of warrior priests that operate from [[Argentum]], handling any evils that arise or heretics that abuse the divine arts. 

# Defeasancey
The conciliate that manages the official judiciary stance of the Theocracy. They reviews cases of heresy, excommunication, and apostasy, acting as the moderating force behind the will of the Benedictiary and the instruction of the Centenary.

## Inquisitorium
Led by a new Archbishop of the Defeasancey, the Inquisitorium has been recently established to further enforce the rulings of the Centenary conciliate and carry out the work of the Defeasancy en-masse, in light of the recent schism.

## Chassurates
The highest-ranking members of the Pulette Knights and the Inquisitorium's arm of judgment within the sanctioned borders of the Theocracy. The order of Chassurates are the only Vólatians apart from the Archbishop of the [[#Defeasancy]] who can suppress the blessing of the divine arts in noble-blooded individuals.

Certain inquisitors are known to seek the blessing of the [[#Benedictiary]], tasked to reach the far corners of civilization alongside a similarly-motivated priest or rector to proselytize the new Vólat-rah orthodoxy further into the far reaches of the sacred isles. These Chassurates are also specifically equipped to deal with any dangerous Vólat-sin zealots that might reject the faith or otherwise seek to undermine the Church beyond the borders of the Theocracy.

Zstalfo Granetoss is among their number.

> [!recite|bg-c-blue] "The Church unites all of mortalkind together. We spread culture and morality throughout all society, that the love of the Kanirûl might be found in everyday life. It might be impossible to imagine that anyone could complain about such altruism... But alas, some do. They are the heretics that have lost their faith and only find meaning in destruction! As inquisitors, you be faced with both the hot aggression and the quiet false teachings of these lost children. Their misguided 'freedoms' break down morality and ethics, abandon the hope of our forefathers, seek to divide people from the unity of Solanas! It is up to us, all of the Inquisitorium, to save these heretics. They have been blinded by the Apathies, given in to the Passions without restraint, and led astray by the machinations of Chaos. When their lives end and their souls pulled to the Gates of Silence, they will descend to Hræth for eternity to be lost in the storm of their iniquity. There is no worse fate... It is the hope of the Benedictiary that you will hear the confessions of these heretics, that you may restore them as radiant children of the new Father and new Mother. Find your path in the words of [[Aethmi-Istar|Holy Aesuhir]] and guide them home. The age of listlessness in the face of the Thinning is ended. It is up to us, to ensure such times never occur in these sacred isles again. You are needed. Through your passion, you may save mortalkind."

# Current Status
Rumors now persist that the [[Vólat Church#Structure#High Priestess|High Priestess]] has commissioned a secret program deep below the [[Argentum|Sanctum of Light]] to prepare for any bloodier conflicts that might arise within the Theocracy.
