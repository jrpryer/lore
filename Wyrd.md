Loosely linked to the [[Anarûl Pantheon|Anarûl]], Wyrd magic is born of sacrifice and will. It is volatile, mysterious, and unpredictable, but at the same time incredibly powerful for those lucky enough to survive channeling it. It is the magic of binding, of physical control, and of blood curses. Wyrd casters have been known to tap into unnatural power through the sacrifice of physical forms, whether it be the ritual disposal of enemy casualties of war or the self-mutilation of their own bodies. It should be noted too that high emotions are often encountered when dealing with the Wyrd, therefore one should carefully watch for the presence of the [[Passions & Apathies]] or risk being overtaken and losing control over their channeling of Wyrd magic. 

The use of Wyrd magic requires a caster to become a conduit. The caster is the material anchor that calls unnatural energies into the world, shaping them to the caster’s will. Dealing with such bizarre forces is incredibly dangerous, and tapping such powers usually requires the assistance of beings familiar with the unfamiliar. Forging a pact with an extraplanar being or negotiating with greater spirits that dwell beyond physical reality are common ways to interact with Wyrd powers while shielding a caster from total ruin. Wyrd magic often breaks the limits of the physical world, weakening the natural boundary to the spiritual realm. While Arcane magic is best used to traverse the universe safely, Wyrd magic _can_ be used to open doors across the fabric of reality as well, albeit with much more risk. 

A spell might be Wyrd if it: 
- Summons a creature from a different plane or realm of existence. 
- Harnesses energy that isn’t elemental in nature. 
- Oppresses the will and mind of a target creature.
