A great disturbance in the cosmos that rippled out from the stars. The mass influx of the sapient species and with them, a new host of lesser gods that would come to be known as the [[Kanirûl Pantheon]].

- - -
An ancient humanoid race known as the [[Idanthi]] were the first sentient inhabitants of the Kanyiiran sphere after the Creation from Chaos. A handful of them settled on the [[Evryn]] Isle but for some reason, died out before a proper land colony could be established.

After the Idanthi came a great disturbance in the cosmos that rippled out from the stars. Perhaps it was from another sphere or perhaps the Origin itself. What came of it, however, was the mass influx of the [[_Lineages|races]] within [[Cara-Dön]]. Starting with the [[Aqualii]] who thrived in the watery landscape, a dozen different species found themselves walking amongst the lush fields and glistening shores of the [[Delipol]] paradise. These were called the **First Children**, the generation that witnessed the great drawing-in of those first breaths. They were of many ages, as were recorded in the first Strixian census, though all appeared with the markings of adulthood in there respective species.

With these First Children came their gods, the Echnicans that would be known as the deities of the [[Kanirûl Pantheon]]. Those powerful and majestic beings [[Kanirûl Pantheon#A Dream For A Seedling World|made it a point]] to gather their subjects and declare the tenants of life and death, discipline and fervor, abundance and famine. This was necessary, since the First Children were of many languages and disparate habits. And so the gods dwelt amongst the races of Cara-Dön, ruling separate kingdoms under a religion of unity, guiding and protecting the diverse peoples that they would carefully develop into thriving civilizations of order. It became quite clear that the Kanirûl deities cultivated the founding of these great nations and people groups of the sacred isles for a purpose, as their cities and temples can be measured at a near-perfect distance out from one another so as to avoid crowding the natural resources and influence the development of culture and society that might arise from their neighbors.
