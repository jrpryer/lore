Focusing on the inhabitants of the continent of Dön, the region in the center of the main island is slightly arid but home to the people within the mighty mechanists of the Tarani Houses. They are an innovative, clever, and somewhat greedy people, ruled by the desire for invention and military power. Most citizens in the nation are terrace farmers, infrastructure builders, standing militia, or factory workers, all reaping the fruits of the labor shared down from the coffers of the artisan guilds and mercantile shipping lanes. Their vibe is heavily inspired by real-world French, Portuguese, and British influences of the 1700's. Their dominance of naval power keeps their trade ways protected from the many roving pirate gangs that crawl the southern isles. They are an odd mix of politicians, artisans, and militia.

Theirs is a society with the highest number of mixed cultures, which has raised a point of contention recently regarding the dukes: the ruling class consists primarily of one large family of [[Tieflings]]

## History
The noble House Taran has guided Dön for centuries, tracing the lineage of its ruling class back to the first leader of [[Caergold]], chosen by [[Pyronia]] herself, king Rhone Taran. Believing the wiping of their memories to have been a boon and sign of great change for their people, the king took a surname from [[Nashtara]] itself, binding his heritage and that of his children to the history of life's greatest emergence on the sphere.


# Current Status
The dukes struggle to balance tradition and progress in their every-evolving industrial society. In Caergold, the head of the family, Rhodahn Taran relies on the counsel of his blunt warrior sister, General Jadera, who commands the nation's armies in beating back the [[Is'Deli Brotherhood]]. Meanwhile, his young idealistic son Corin pushes for the religious reform offered by the Volat-rah orthodoxy and tests his father's patience weekly. The matriarch Esme contends with the overbearing dukes in the western cities of ??? and ??? who are seeking more authority to extend House Taran's borders even further into the low plains of ??? and even [[Pahlássia]]. 
Duke Boros of Néten also schemes to wed his son to Rhodahn and Esme's youngest daughter Caria, so he might cement his claim to his own inheritance of the family's power. 

House Taran is pushing for a breakthrough in industry and factorial work and has begun construction of the first railway stretching across their territory. 
It is also at the forefront of a renaissance of reason, being the only nation to not only refuse the new Vólat-rah orthodoxy, but to also carry forward the fervor of [[Vólat Church#Kilkesh Riots|Kilkesh's purge]] against the [[Vólat Church]] and the seizing of all Vólaril artifacts. Needless to say, this has broken their non-aggression pact with the [[Carain Empire]] and has led to heightened tensions on all sides. 
  The citizens under the Tarani banner are troubled by the heavy-handedness of the Theocracy and worry they may be the first nation ever banned from sending its students to study at the [[University Towards Enlightened Truth|UTET]]. They revel in their industrial and doctrinal prosperity, but worry about rising religious instability, along with the ever-present threat of the [[Is'Deli Brotherhood]] prowling their southern isles. The statehouses and council chambers of Tarani dukes are a hotbed of intrigue concerning succession and power struggles, both within their domain and without.
