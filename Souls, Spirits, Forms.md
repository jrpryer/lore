Souls and Spirits are quite distinct; a single soul can have multiple spirits attached or bonded it. Likewise, spirits can be categorized into two groups: lesser and Greater.  
The world is suffused in lesser spirits, sometimes made visible by the presence of the [[Passions & Apathies|Passions or Apathies]], but otherwise lacking any agency or motivations themselves, though these lesser spirits still maintain an affinity or tie to source magics. 

Once a lesser spirit is bound to a soul, that spirit takes physical form and can be thought of as a face or current manifestation of the soul's true identity, stitched together by high-level magic. For instance, the mastery of [[Divine Mastery - Spirit Linking|Divine Spirit Linking]] is capable of stitching a new spirit to a soul, while the master of [[Primordial#Mastery|Primordial True Naming]] is capable of making alterations to a spirit or form entirely. The Soul is the true identity of the being and exists beyond physical space. This allows for spirit manipulation, thought and astral projection, translocation across space and time, and even death of the body as all fairly "normal" occurrences, within the bounds of understanding for the learned. True death of a soul however is a much different and more sacred occurrence; since the soul is the source, once a soul is destroyed, erased, or rewritten, it truly cannot be replaced. Among the [[Family of the Endless]], only [[Life|Rhajos]] has the ability to create new souls. Some lesser spirits may be echoes of a soul that once lived, though it will act very differently in any form and is a fragile thing that is soon to fade.

Individuals with heightened senses or specialized training can often feel the Spiritual presence emitted by beings in their vicinity; just as a heavy liquid inside a container can be felt and movement inferred by placing ones hand alongside, so can the pressure and power of one's spirit be felt. If one such trained person were to come across an individual of incredible, it is very likely they would be overwhelmed.

# Greater Spirits
Greater Spirits on the other hand are Ethereal beings already bound to a soul but have greater control of their source, giving them the ability to manifest a physical form, choosing to alter it under certain circumstances but always maintaining consciousness without needing to remain corporeal. Often, Greater Spirits will choose to go about formless for their own safety and freedom, only choosing to manifest a body when great need arises or complex communication is required with mortal beings.

# Afterlife
Each of the [[Anarûl Pantheon|Anarûl]] %% by nature of being one of the Endless  %%has the power to create and destroy demiplanes associated with their domains of power. This nature seeped into their early creations and connected them to the mortal beings born of that power. The ultimate destination of a soul heavily depends on what Mother or Father its species or lineage is tied to, and where the being placed its faith during its time of walking.

Primarily, Kanyiiran souls are judged by [[Entropy|Tevros]], and ferried to The [[Muérai|Gates of Silence]] to be ushered into [[Muérai]] and live in the layer upon which they have earned their rest. 
Currently, it is unknown what happens to the souls of Echnicans {[[Echni]]}, Daemons {[[Abythras]]}, or Celestials {[[Lämmrus]]}

# Spiritual Composition
Soul = one's identity, character, memory, and center of higher existential faculty
Spirit = one's will, power, and autonomy, always anchored in a [[Laws of True Magic|Source]]
Form = one's bodily constitution, strength, and instinct, influenced by Source

To further illustrate this framework, we can examine the possible combinations that exist in the Mundane, Ethereal, and Beyond [[Planes of Existence|planes]], denoting the primary manifested stage in <span style= "color: skyblue;font-weight: bold">blue</span>:

Soul -> Spirit -> <span style= "color: skyblue;font-weight: bold">Form</span> — a "normal" mundane existence of a mortal creature, existing in the Mundane plane.  
Soul -> <span style= "color: skyblue;font-weight: bold">Spirit</span> -> Form — a Greater Spirit, living primarily in the Ethereal plane but capable of passing into the Mundane plane.  
Soul -> <span style= "color: skyblue;font-weight: bold">Spirit</span> x ~~Form~~ — a shadow, or wraith that has lost its form, living solely in the Ethereal plane.
<span style= "color: skyblue;font-weight: bold">Soul</span> x ~~Spirit~~ x ~~Form~~ — an identity left adrift, existing only in the Beyond where the Mothers and Fathers alone may walk undisturbed.
~~Soul~~ x <span style= "color: skyblue;font-weight: bold">Spirit</span> -> Form — a lesser spirit or wisp, existing only in the Ethereal plane, but still capable of being bound to a Form to give it animation in the Mundane plane by masters of Divine arts.
~~Soul~~ x Spirit -> <span style= "color: skyblue;font-weight: bold">Form</span> — a monstrosity, revenant, sentient object, or other facsimile of life, that exists in the Mundane plane for a singular purpose.
~~Soul~~ x ~~Soul~~ x <span style= "color: skyblue;font-weight: bold">Form</span> — a golem, zombie, or construct that mimics the basic functions of life but without ties to any higher power, existing only in the Mundane plane.
