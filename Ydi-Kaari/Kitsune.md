The Kitsune were driven to near-extinction during the Thinning wars, seen as favored by the Spirits of Kanyiirah and exploited for their potent spellcasting. They were recruited and used by their Elvi commanders and leaders as conduits of magic on the battlefield, which also made them primary targets.

Kitsune were trapped just as much by their enemies as their own commanders; their shapeshifting abilities lacked practiced longevity and could not be maintained for long durations, making escape from the battlefield possible, but not probable. Any Kitsune that managed to escape the bloodshed were quickly discovered again and pressed into the service of another warlord or rising government, being deemed too valuable to the war efforts. And yes, that frustration led many to adopt a code of extreme "scorched-earth" conduct that led to their destruction.

Their brief shapeshifting abilities created a cruel irony, as they were powerful enough to be valuable, but not powerful enough to ensure their own extrication from danger. Their "scorched-earth" response reflects the psychology of cornered survivors choosing destruction over continued exploitation. 
Current Kitsune survivors in hiding harbor extreme mistrust of authority figures.
