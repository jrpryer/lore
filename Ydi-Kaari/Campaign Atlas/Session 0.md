Lay the four Aces and Joker in a star pattern at center of table. 

Players place a d6 on their chosen Rune

Deal each player three normal playing cards; red cards angle towards Weal, black towards Woe. The Majority color of all 4 cards determine Orientation; a tie is Balanced. Note that, and as your Fusion is built in the next step, orient the card to your chosen ruin sideways for Balanced, end to end for Weal, or corner to corner for Woe. 

Each player gifts one of their three cards to another PC—this gift forges the fusion bond to the gifted player's chosen Keystone Rune, if the suits differ. (face cards represent  Myst Runes for forging fusions)

Or, w/ tarot:

| Suit          | Keystone Rune |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **Pentacles** | Bloom         |
| **Wands**     | Star          |

| **Swords**    | Ruin          |
| **Royal**     | Myst          |
Counting the suit of your chosen Primary Keystone...
	Each **red** minor (Cups / Wands  -  Veil / Star) nudges you one step toward **Weal**
	Each **black** minor (Swords / Pentacles  -  Ruin / Bloom) nudges toward **Woe**
	If you end up with equal red and black → **Balanced**
