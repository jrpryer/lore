The gods were called together by [[Tympestyr]], just off the northern coast of [[Delipol]]. There, something occurred between them and the Titan [[Umbravex]]; in an event that became known simply as **The Departure**, a violent [[Eternal Maelstrom|maelstrom]] formed at the site of their gathering, and the walking gods of the [[Kanirûl Pantheon|Kanirûl]] were never seen nor heard from again.
