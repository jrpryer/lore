Wars fought between new nations of the sacred isles, severely diminishing the populations of select species. Commonly called the Thinning.

---
Wars began cropping up all around just as new governments formed, defensive cities built, deadly weapons crafted, and essential fields sown. Thankfully the forethought of the [[Kanirûl Pantheon|Kanirûl]] gods and variety of species that walked with them, mass genocides were avoided. But the numbers of Nagaji, Urik, Strix, Ghoran, and Kitsune communities were severely diminished.

In total, there were 9 Thinning wars, fought over the control of relics, then of heritage, then of resources. Ultimately, the Carain Empire rose and dominated the majority of Cara, instilling a forced peace that quickly spread to the rest of the Isles. Their state religion, the orthodox Vólat Church, did much to calm the panicky atmosphere that clouded the minds of most, bringing the fervor of war and scramble for power back from the brink and encouraging a realignment with the words and teachings of the [[Kanirûl Pantheon|Kanirûl]] that had defined hope and peace and justice.

The [[University Towards Enlightened Truth]] (UTET) was established and philosophers and great charismatic leaders were educated to break the ideological fallacies and lies that had perpetuated the wars of the Thinning, dramatically reducing the effect of the generational trauma of those dark times. Urik specifically are treated as honored warriors who withstood the violent test of time. Many are now elevated to positions of knighthood or command or given land and titles where their fathers or grandfathers fell in battle as recompense. Only the Carain Empire dares ask an Urik lord to swear fealty to the ruling body; all other factions in the Sacred Isles allow Urik families to ascribe their own loyalties.
