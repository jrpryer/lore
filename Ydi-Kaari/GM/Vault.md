Hexcrawling _might_ be the way to go... "A good hex map contains narratives. As opposed to deciding plot points ahead of time and distilling them into scenes, the story in a hexcrawl writes itself as it occurs." ... "A robust hexcrawl then, serves to create a campaign that 'runs itself'. It is a perpetual motion machine of adventure. The GM does not need to act as illusionist or puppeteer, but rather presents the world and how it reacts to the players’ actions. In this way, the GM meets the players at the table and works with them as they take ownership over the imagined world they share."

# Details
- The world is still young; the first generations of dragons have yet to age into their greatest size or acquire continent-defining hoards.

 - From Chaos first came [[Primordial]] source, the beginning of life and the power of creation. [[Arcane]] source came next, ordering the new cosmos into rules and laws. [[Wyrd]] source then arose, seeping from the universal “wounds” of their conflict and becoming the space between distances, asymmetrical life that consumes and spreads. [[Divine]] source then arose last, to heal the wounds of Wyrd and seal, keep, and protect the universe in its beautiful, imperfect state. Once all four where present, Arcane respected the balance and ended hostilities against Primordial, though, the font of Chaos at the universal Origin would not be quenched.
 - Chaos then gained sentience and chose to shepherd the sources of magic. Soon though, Chaos realized it bore too much power. It turned to sequencing the Harmonious Chord into patterns of Infinity, searching the truths of Arcane for a way to contain itself into one such sequence. But a way could not be found; it was now only a breaker, a destroyer, and the maker of wounds. 
 - And so Chaos stepped into the universal Origin and performed the first fragmentation, dividing itself into new Divine Souls and [[Primordial Mastery - True Naming|Naming]] these entities the [[Family of the Endless]], the successors of its power and responsibilities. Newly born, the Endless flung themselves out from the universal Origin, scattering its motes of Infinity into the cosmos and seeding the young, burgeoning universe with waves of the unregulated power of creation and destruction. Soon though, they calmed and gathered together to take up the mantle of their predecessor: the shepherding of the source magics and maintaining the beauty of the balanced multiverse.

# Source Magic mechanics
Divine source: Spiritual Fading — Each cast of Divine magic increments a stacking Faded count that draws one closer to the Spiritual realm, making lesser spirits more and more visible and even drawing the attention of greater spirits once the count reaches 15. The nature of this attention is decided by a d8 roll: 1-2: Negative attention – A minor complication, such as a demanding obstruction, or fleeting interference requiring an immediate act of devotion or penance (e.g., a vow, offering, or ritual). 3-5: Neutral ripple – The spirit’s presence leaves a vague impression that lingers around the caster, visible to others who can perceive the spiritual realm. 6+: Positive echo – Temporary boons tied to the spirit’s domain bless the caster (e.g., heightened charisma, resistance to specific damage types, or advantage on saving throws in certain situations).  

Wyrd source: Burden Tethers — Each use of Wyrd magic requires sacrifice, a decrement of a limited resource. A caster must prepare a Burden Tether, whether it is bound to the body like a tattoo, scar, or sigil, or a favored object like a book or beaded talisman. When the Tether is created, roll a d20 + 10 to determine its capacity for Burdens. Each Wyrd spell that is cast incurs a number of Burdens equal to a d4 roll, the result of which is subtracted from the capacity of the Tether. If the accumulated Burdens exceed the capacity of the Tether, the bound object is consumed and the caster is subjected to a mental/physical “encounter” and is unable to cast further Wyrd spells until a new Tether is created. Such encounters often leave wounds or sometimes scars (mental or physical).  

Primordial source: Universal Resonance — Primordial magic formed the foundation of the cosmos and still carries the echoing power that mimics the harmony of reality itself, creating ripples in the unseen threads that bind the universe together. Every instance of Primordial magic emits resonance, which can enhance subsequent spellcasting—but at the risk of overloading the caster or distorting the spell. Every time Primordial magic is called upon, casters add 1 chord of Resonance to their pool. Before casting, the caster can decide to draw from the Resonance Pool to amplify their spell’s power, adding +1 to spell attack and damage rolls per Resonance Point used. However, for every Resonance Point used in this way, roll a d20: 1-2: the spell misfires, causing unintended effects (chosen by the DM or rolled on a Primordial Mishaps Table). If the Resonance Pool exceeds a threshold (e.g., 5), the next Primordial spell automatically triggers a misfire, resetting the pool to 0 and triggering a Mishap.  

Arcane source: Equation Balancing — spells rely on perfectly balanced formulas. Imbalances in magical equations cause cumulative distortions that demand careful management. Each Arcane caster begins with a Balance Tracker at 0. Each Arcane spell cast adds or subtracts points from the tracker, depending on the spell's type: Evocation, Apocalypse, Mythos +3 | Fiendish, Chronomancy, Temporal, Necromancy +2 | Transmutation, Conjuration, Combat, Labyrinth, Liminal +1 | 0 | Elven, Ley, Ring, Winter, Alkemancy -1 | Dragon, Illumination, Clockwork, Enchantment -2 | Angelic, Abjuration -3. If the Balance Tracker exceeds a threshold (e.g., +10 or -10), the caster makes a Constitution (Arcana) save to maintain equilibrium. A failure triggers an Equation Distortion, such as having the spell implode dealing minor damage to the caster, the caster being affected by an unintended magical condition (e.g., floating, glowing, or losing speech temporarily), etc. Fully resting allows the caster to reset the balance to 0.



# Plots
## Witnesses of the Departure
[[Entropy|Mykaedra]], the queen of the [[Muérai|Underworld]], seeks to collect the Infinite fragments of Myst from the [[Kanirûl Pantheon|Kanirûl]]. Her [[Yggrāhkærn#^9c44a6|Titan-spawn]] general Catastrophe is sent, to stir them and destroy what they have built, electing to weaken them before crushing them fully.

The [[Vólat Church]] scrambles to identify this powerful force that is capable of standing up to their deities. They adopts the theodicy of **the Complex**, born of some true, otherworldly constant that seeks only to destroy the order of civilization. All things that destroy must be commanded by the Complex, for only the most potent force of chaos could be capable of posing such a consistent and dangerous threat to the immortal [[Kanirûl Pantheon|Kanirûl]]. Though it is not the official stance of the church for fear of sowing discord among the [[Vólat Church|Vólaril]], many bishops also believe the Complex to be aided by the Father [[Entropy|Tevros]], as entropy appears to be the ultimate outcome of chaos and destruction, in there eyes.

## Legacy of Cutthroats
### Intro
scene will be a reading of a captain’s log for a high brow merchant vessel, speaking on the ships recent departure from a wealthy Ropheshian port. It would give super basic context to the nations and trade relations, as well as the value of the haul they are bringing to the lesser isle of Trilun. This reading will eventually be interrupted by the Pirate Captain that just boarded the merchant ship and is making the merchant translate the log out loud for a select group of crew to hear. Juxtaposing the scene from the moment the log was written to the present, in the middle of the act of piracy. Fun!

"You only drink this when things get *very* dire, you hear me? Only when shit hits the rudder."

- Perhaps the [[Carain Empire|Imperial]] tie-in is a stolen, cursed [[Aethmi-Istar#Artifacts|Istarian relic]]?

- The cursed beings of [[Evryn]] have begun to haunt the coasts of the [[Vólatian Theocracy]] and the western coasts of Dön in the domains of the [[Erdö]] Gleamwood.

- Player Bastions... that have a living soul bound to them, Not exactly a haunting spirit, but rather the place, or building itself is sentient and has its own history and goals.

- "For the sanctity of these blessed isles, the [[Vólatian Theocracy#Benedictiary|Benedictiary]] hereby authorizes you to PURGE"
- "For the glory of our mighty Empire, your Tsarina hereby authorizes you to VANQUISH"
- "As the House-sword of Caergold, the Tarani Dukes have authorized you to BURN"


# GM Tips
A settings strengths is not just in its logic and logistics, but also really in the VIBES, the juice, the synergy of commitment. That had more pragmatic weight in bringing joy to the player. 

“The story has to be predicated on the dreams, hopes, desires, and ACTIONS of the PCs; if their choices are not what’s driving the story forward, that’s a problem. Obviously those chosen occur in a world that the DM provides—villains and plot hooks and lore — for them to react to. But the STORY that is being told needs to fit the characters that are in the telling of it.”

Building on this… good art asks a question, but doesn’t lead the audience to a prepared answer. Spending all the time and energetic to get to your own predicted end is… predictable. Un-engaging. Boring. Write a book or a dissertation, if that’s what you want to do. The FUN and impactful moments come from expertly preparing and asking the questions for the audience to answer. And don’t simply ask redundant questions either, make it a question they have to wrestle with. Take yourself out of the audience’s seat and remember to play the role of storyteller/question-asker first. The answer doesn’t need to be known beforehand. I’m not a teacher; I don’t have all the answers. Leave some room to be surprised yourself, by the answers.
