The creation of the blades was a true marvel: using her [[Divine Mastery - Spirit Linking|mastery of Divine]] source magic, [[Pyronia]] labored to forge the blades without steel or smoke, instead crafting the blades from the divine substance of [[Malovelium]]‌ and entrapping the volatile infused [[Anarûl Pantheon#Runes|Anarûl Runes]] between two opposing lesser Runes — created by her and her husband, [[Borealis]] — inside each of the weapons' cores that would not break or rust with time, making the blades capable of severing a spirit from any form that was anchored in the corresponding source magic of each blade.

These mighty Runeblades were recorded as follows:
# Sol'ena
"Light's Grace"
- Formed to fell the Divine Phoenix, [[Caelaistra]]  
# Ek’loma
"The Night Reaver"
- Fated to slay that Wyrd Aberration called [[Umbravex]]
# Lem'raux
"Mystic's Bane"
- Fashioned to bring low the searing Arcane force of [[Ferrovus]]
# Thal'vyorn
"The Incarnate Flame"
- The most powerful of the holy blades
- Forged to dispel the wards surrounding the slumbering Primordial simian, [[Sylvania]]

# Perversion of Order
Though their intentions were for self preservation, [[Pyronia]] and [[Borealis]] created powerful artifacts in the Runeblades, as they exist in direct opposition of the natural state of source magics. Even Wyrd source, though it exists as the wounds of the universe, still seeks to consume, grow, and spread, while the Runeblades seek only to sever and destroy the bonds of Aether in every form. They are sentient blades as well, highly opinionated regarding how they are used and incredibly selective over who wields them, now that their [[Kanirûl Pantheon|Kanirûl]] creators have Departed.
