Born of dark Wyrd experiments done by the [[SECRETS#The 5th Family|5th Family]] Vampyrs to orphaned Elvi newborns.

Favored at their birth by the [[Passions & Apathies|Passions]] and blessed to bond and speak with lesser Spirits, these naturally-gifted sorceresses were the bent and twisted shadows of what their younger Blood Witch sisters eventually became.

Traumatized since their earliest memories, the Hags of the Silver Hills were taught to take and twist the world to their own whims and designs, rooted in selfish greed and narcissism, they torment the inhabitants of Cara, unleashing curses, charms, and monsters of their own vile creations to feed the [[Passions & Apathies|Apathies]] and spite the Passions that abandoned them.
