The fallen [[Vaal'k|Vaal'kuhrea]] that led the [[Drakhaën]] exodus from [[Lämmrus|Lusturil]] to Kanyiirah. 
Twin demigod daughters of the Ascended mortal [[Aethmi-Istar]]. They were at first ambitious opportunists who saw the [[Drakhaën|Narithalë]] mystics fall into obsession with their Arcane experiments. It took very little effort for the sisters to sow selfishness and greed into the proud Ilystrin, encouraging them to explore the limits of the dangerous magics and consider the possibilities of altering forms with this power. 

Image how much greater their standing and power within the hierarchal structure of the [[Gilded Order]] would be with such discoveries? But when the greater ruling deity of the Gilded Order, [[Life|Xëk'Liën]], discovered the intentions of the Narithalë, she cursed them into the forms of [[Drakhaën|dragons]] and exiled them from [[Lämmrus|Lusturil]].

# outcasts of Radiance 
The sisters saw an opportunity to lead the group themselves, and so attempted to join the exiles with their current hereditary blessings intact. But Xëkliën saw through their schemes and cursed them as well to be shadows of their former selves, darkened and fallen:

The bearing of their birthright — their feathered, beautiful wings — were twisted into fleshy, batlike things, stretched over slender bones and ending in stunted spikes. Long, slender horns sprouted from their foreheads and whip-like tails from the bases of their spines. Their glowing, golden skin turned to a rusted red colour. 

And so the sisters became the fallen Shaedriël; thus spited, they bitterly led the Drakhaën exodus from the heavenly realm down to [[Kanyiirah]].

Language: [[Lustrálian]]
- Shae- ~ From the root Shaeus (shadow or veil), which implies a moral or spiritual obscurity, a veiling of truth or light
- -dri- ~ Derived from Driorum (to corrupt), which suggests an active transformation, often unnatural or malevolent
- -ël ~ A common suffix from Elos (divine essence)' when used in titles, -ël marks the bearer as belonging to the celestial order.

## Forgotten Birthright
Ironically, though they were cursed with twisted and mutilated forms, the Shaedriël were re-anchored securely in Divine source magic after the [[Laws of True Magic#Convergence|Convergence]] at their exile. 

Zýrathar saw the alteration as a boon, a glimmer of hope in their exile; there was a connection to their gentle Divine mother [[Valencia]], moving her to lead her Zy'kryn as a nurturing matron and paragon of moral righteousness.

Anílanthë on the other hand, took this as another biter betrayal: a taunting of their lost inheritance in the radiant realm. She leads her An'kryn with a dominating force of will, as their Wyrd source instills in them affinities for destruction and dominance.
