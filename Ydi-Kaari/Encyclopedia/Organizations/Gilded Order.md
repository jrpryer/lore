[[Life|Liën]] rules [[Lämmrus]] with brilliant vision, maintaining a strict hierarchy of law and order across the entire sphere.

With her as its figurehead, the Gilded Order is led by her three chosen **Archons**, who each maintain a revolving council of 7 **Empyreans**, who are themselves each elected by the #Ilystrin denizens of the world. These senators of the Order are then charged with the recruitment of their own 12 **Solar Legions**, keenly selecting their **Deva** arbiters to maintain civility and order within the ranks.

[[Aethmi-Istar]] is the only Empyrean to hold the position on a unanimous vote since his arrival, rotating through the courts of all three Archons.
