Legend says that the first beings to claim this sphere were [[Family of the Endless|ancient spirits]] of raging chaos. They arrived with violent speed and bathed every kilometer of the land in their awesome power, [[Kanyiirah|shaping the land, sea, and sky]]. After a time, these elder beings calmed and chose new forms for themselves, coalescing into their four avatars, the Fathers and Mothers that would become ordered into the **Upper Anarûl Pantheon**. 

Those that witnessed their awesome power in action claimed to distinguish unique patterns amongst the members of the Anarûl. These became known as their signature Runes and the basis for the written languages of Cara-Dön.  
  
These avatars were known as:
- [[Fate|Asteria]] 'The Widow' - Mother of the Stars, keeper of the Foresight Rune
- [[Entropy|Tevros]] 'The Judge of Souls' - Father of War, keeper of the Death Rune
- [[Life|Rhajos]] 'The Herald of Delights' - Father of Revelry, keeper of the Blood Rune
- [[Darkness|Vespera]] 'The Veiled One' - Mother of Trickery, keeper of the Night Rune

Together with the [[Kanirûl Pantheon|Kanirûl]], the Anarûl were combined into the overall **Vólaril** {VOH-lah-ril} pantheon as worshiped by the original [[Vólat Church]]. When the church ratified the schism, the two sects were called the Vólat-rah and Vólat-sin to better identify their loyalties in regards to the two pantheons.
