The [[Strix]] people best record [[Nashtara]] as a great disturbance in the cosmos; something that rippled out from the stars. Perhaps it was from another sphere or perhaps even the  Origin. What came of it, however, was the mass influx of the [[_Lineages|races]] within [[Cara-Duhn]] and with them, a new host of lesser gods that stepped from the first-world into Kanyiirah. These beings each held an immense font of magic power and would come to be known as the **Middle Kanirûl Pantheon**:

- **[[Solanas]]** 'The Dawnfather' - God of the Suhns and Light, husband to Lunatas
- **[[Lunatas]]** 'The Dreamweaver' - Goddess of the Moons and Wards, chosen of Myst, wife of Solanas
- **[[Tympestyr]]** 'The Stormbreaker' - God of Storms and the Seas
- **[[Taerannon]]** 'The Untamed' - God of Nature and father of the beasts that roam the isles
- **[[Pyronia]]** 'The Fiery Heart' - Goddess of Fire and the Forge of invention, wife of Borealis
- **[[Borealis]]** 'The Frozen Heart' - God of Winter and the Northern Ice, husband to Pyronia
- **[[Valencia]]** 'The Heartkindler' - Goddess of Love and Beauty

  
Together with the [[Anarûl Pantheon|Anarûl]], the Kanirûl were combined into the overall **Vólaril** {VOH-lah-ril} pantheon as worshiped by the original [[Vólat Church]]. When the church ratified its schism, two sects were defined, called the Vólat-sin and Vólat-rah to better identify their loyalties in regards to the two pantheons.

# From Another Place
Though each member of the Middle Pantheon carried with them great power, it is known that they all shared a unique heritage and seemed to bear deep emotions towards their previous homeland. Colloquially called the first-world, Greater Echnica was a realm suffused in deep magic and strong emotional energies. It was reflected in the eyes of the walking gods and in their demeanors and mannerisms when they were together.

It should also be mentioned that each member of the Middle Pantheon towered over the races that they governed, reaching average heights of 2.5 meters (~8'2"). It was said that [[Solanas|The Dawnfather]] and [[Taerannon|The Untamed]] — who each stood to a full 3 meters (~9'8") — were the largest of the pantheon and would wrestle for sport during grand feasts; a practice that oft led to major structural damage at the site of these bouts.

The gods spoke little of their previous lives to the mortals who worshiped them, save the [[The Burning of Dèndronaos#To The First Children|first account]] given by The Dreamweaver, Lunatas in the earliest hours of [[Nashtara]]: her husband Solanas — driven by grief at the loss of their children in an unspeakable betrayal — opened a path for his people and brought them to a new home to escape the burning of their World Tree back in Greater Echnica. For this reason, members of the Middle Pantheon referred to their culture as Echnican. 

# A Dream For A Seedling World
The king of the Kanirûl was a visionary and lawmaker without equal. His dream for the many societies of [[Cara-Duhn]] was one of gilded luster; inheritances of opulence and abundant riches that would enable the people of these sacred isles to live freely as they will. With the gods maintaining order — both from within the fledgling nations and from their seat of power in [[Ech'Yinara]] — there was no fear of unjust slaughter in war, irrevocable starvation from famine, or chronic illness of the body.

They dwelt amongst the races of Cara-Duhn, ruling separate kingdoms under a religion of unity, guiding and protecting the diverse peoples that would develop into thriving civilizations of order. It became quite clear that the Kanirûl cultivated the founding of the great nations and people groups of the world with great purpose, as their cities and temples were near-perfectly spread out from one another, to not crowd the natural development of culture and society that might arise from their neighbors. Death was honored as a rare and celebrated event, ushering souls onward to [[Entropy|Tevros]]' embrace with reverence. This was the age of long bright days and an explosion of spiritual growth, technical innovation, and cultural enlightenment.

## Tenuous Neighbors
Though there does exist early records of the Kanirûl meeting with the [[Anarûl Pantheon|Anarûl]] at [[Ech'Yinara]], a lasting peace was never found between the servants of the Upper Pantheon and the Nashtaran Walking Gods. And within ??? years #REVIEW, the close proximity of the [[Titans]] became a problem for the Kanirûl, as their infrequent interactions became increasingly violent...

## Bearers of Runes
After seeing the effectiveness of [[Pyronia]]'s craftmanship in forging the [[Runeblades]], The Stormbreaker [[Tympestyr]] championed the pursuit of crafting more powerful artifacts using the same techniques and materials, to arm select champions of the Kanirûl in defense of the sacred isles. 
Bestowing these new Runes became ceremonious for a time, revered amongst the [[Vólat Church]] and further adopted by [[Aethmi-Istar|Holy Aesuhir]] for crafting blessed relics for the defense of the temple at [[Argentum]] — though these were made from more common materials and bore only one Rune within their cores.

# History
This Pantheon was brought forth along with the [[_Lineages|Kanyiiran People]] during [[Nashtara]], guiding societal and technological developments of the Cara-Duhnian people with a heavy hand until their [[The Departure|Departure]].
