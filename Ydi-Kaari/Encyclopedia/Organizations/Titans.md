# History
>[!recite|bg-c-gray] *One portion of the Kanyiiran sphere chiefly drew the attention of the [[Anarûl Pantheon|Fathers and Mothers]], and it became their shared goal to send down servants and prepare this land for the habitation of sentient life. Their motivations for doing so are speculated upon, but the Vólat-sin traditions claim that they wished to share the beauty of the Sphere with all life. Great Titans were manifested by the Anarûl deities, each infused with the core of a source magic and fed by the currents of chaos their masters tethered to them.*  

%% The Kanyiiran Titans were Greater Spirits of [[Yggrāhkærn]], [[Lämmrus]], [[Abythras]], and [[Echni]], all bound to their hulking forms by the [[Anarûl Pantheon|Anarûl]] and promised by the Mothers and Fathers that once they fulfilled their task, they would be restored to even greater affluence. %%

Ancient songs of the [[Aqualii]] are the most verbose in the telling of the story, recounting the following myth:
- Tevros brought forth **[[Ferrovus]]** the Arcane Colossus from the bones of Kanyiirah, an armored four-armed giant wreathed in lava who hewed islands and forged volcanos with his molten hands. He was the first to split the continents apart with his hammer, forging the rugged spine of [[Cara]], carving out [[Evryn]] and [[Delipol]], and smashing the lesser isles into place along [[Dön]]'s coasts. It was believed that he lay his fiery hammer up along the mountainous edge of Cara for a time, and it melted the glaciers there, leaving behind the deep fjord that leads on into the mountains.

- Asteria next pulled down **[[Caelaistra]]** the Divine Phoenix from the heavens of [[Lämmrus|Lusturil]], a colossal white phoenix with a burning comet tail who carved valleys and mountains with her disintegrating celestial fire. She was dragged down from the sky's tapestry against her will and first turned her anger towards Dön. The buffeting of her wings cratered the center of the continent, blasting the loose rock to fine sand and her talons rent a canyon through the stubborn rock that remained. She then sliced apart massive valleys and bleached the landscape of Cara with her cometary impacts, while glaciating the [[Frostfire Peaks]] with her frigid stellar tail.

- Vespera coaxed an Aberration called **[[Umbravex]]** from a place of Wyrd shadow and cold aether; a tentacled crustation of a dark sort that dredged the ocean depths and hollowed cavern systems with its entropic dark energy. It carved the ocean floor between all the land masses, lingering within the spaces between Delipol and the Lesser Isles to create the winding, flooded caverns of Azentrim that the Aqualii would eventually come to call home. Deepening the strait and perforating the continental shelves with abyssal chasms to the north and east, Umbravex's darkness still lingers at the deepest depths.

- Rhajos then finally manifested **[[Sylvania]]** the Primordial Sapien, a vibrant two-headed simian covered in moss and flowers who cultivated forests and jungles in her footsteps, leaving the most fertile land in her wake. Sometimes called the verdant titan, she wandered along Cara's eastern coast for a time, before Caelaistra's fire forced her south to [[Delipol]]. Her feat bathed those cliffs in a rolling green carpet of lush grassland as she lingered here, before being ferried south and west by Umbravex. Her long arms dragged in the waters off the southern coast of Dön, wreathing the broken islands there in bright corral reefs and leaving behind a trail of glistening tropical isles in her wake. She then walked [[Evryn]] far inland, raising around her the deep and majestic forests of the Evryn wilds, her low songs filling jungles there with new magic that many still feel humming in its trees and caverns to this day. It is also said that Sylvania lived the shortest life of all the Titans. As she fell into her final slumber, [[Ferrovus]] — having bathed in the waters of the lesser isles and cooled his fiery limbs — lifted her from the shores of the minor isle and strode across the channel to the south-western coast of Dön, laying her large form to rest at the center of a shining lake he carved for her.  

After the work of the Titans was complete, they wondered without purpose for an unknown time. Eventually, [[Nashtara]] brought an explosion of new life to the fertile cradle of Cara-Dön and a great host of mortals and new gods found themselves living in close proximity with these archaic beings of power.

## Fate of the Titans
[[Kanirûl Pantheon#Tenuous Neghbors|Before long]], the Dawnfather [[Solanas]] tasked the Fiery Heart [[Pyronia]] to craft four great weapons of singular destiny; legendary **[[Runeblades]]**, each imbued by the will of the entire [[Kanirûl Pantheon]] to combat the affinities of the four Titans, so the safety and longevity of the young races might be assured.  
  
It was no secret that the Fathers and Mothers of Kanyiirah opposed the idea of their Titans being destroyed, as they were the first creations of the [[Anarûl Pantheon]] and seemed to still play some unperceivable role in the workings of the sphere. While his initial intentions may have been honest, this course taken by King Solanas would lead to direct confrontation and conflict amongst the Vólaril for the first time.

> [!recite|bg-c-gray] _Though accounts conflict, there is a leading consensus among UTET scholars that believes the Titans possessed two forms, not unlike mortal beings today. That of their 'walking form' — the behemoth-like physical bodies that carved the land — and another form of spirit, one that could converse and perhaps influence auras, but struggled to take physical shape._  

>[!recite|bg-c-gray] - _Sylvania died her first death in Ferrovus' arms we believe around ~195 BD, not long after her task was complete. Her great form lay still for many years in the [[Erdö]] valley, untouched by rot or decomposition, leading the Kanirûl to remain wary of her and create Lem'urex lest she simply be in slumber. Her spirit has not been seen in the lands of Erdö for generations and is assumed to have suffered her second death sometime before ~100 BD._  
    
>[!recite|bg-c-gray] - _Ferrovus disappeared under the earth, fleeing the sight of the Kanirûl and the mortal races of Nashtara, leaving no trace of his first death. However, the folktale of 'Caelaistra's Fall' provides a first-hand account that leads many to trust his first death to be assured around the year ~188 BD. Nothing is known of his second death._   

>[!recite|bg-c-gray] - _The record of 'Caelaistra's Fall' was captured from the eyewitness account of the Bladesman Rukhzar Mao himself, pointedly marking the Divine Titan's first and second deaths simultaneously in 174 BD. The legend has also provided the main body of empirical evidence that this 'theory of second deaths' extrapolates._  
    
>[!recite|bg-c-gray] - _Umbravex is the only titan still believed to possess its mortal form. So little is known about the Wyrd beast, we have only the myths and legends recorded from the earliest years of Nashtara to even know of its existence. And understandably, little effort has been made to try and corroborate the claims of pirates and deranged seamen that crop up in the Western and Southern oceans; stories that speak of dark monsters swimming leagues beneath the surface, yet large enough to cast great shadows during moments of calm upon those waters..._  

>[!recite|bg-c-gray] _There is still so much we don't know regarding the Titans and their purpose. It is my hope that new discoveries will come to us from the relic hunters that brave the wilds of Evyrn isle._
