# The Primordial Sapien
The [[Primordial]] [[Titans|Titan]] was a two-headed being covered in thick vines, heavy moss, and vibrant flowers. Her nature was calm as she cultivated the fertile lands of the sacred Isles. The legends record that she walked for only a short time, due to the nature of [[Life|Rhajos]]' work on her form. Limited by the [[Laws of True Magic|Third Law of True Magic]], her form was weakened and her life force waned as she finished her task.

## Sylvania's Breath
Though her Form [[Titans#Fate of the Titans|was the weakest]] of the Titans, her Spirit was by far the strongest, enduring%% in her capacity as a powerful Greater Spirit%% long after her first death and capable of communing with those that sought her wisdom and strength.
She is known to favor the meek, humble, lost, afraid, patient, and kind, as well empowering any that seek to protect such others or defend the sanctity of the land from exploitation and theft of its natural resources.

She was also the chosen voice of Kanyiirah itself, having bonded with the Soul of the sphere upon the first arrival of the Titans. Though she maintains her autonomy, the sphere had been known to speak through her as a proxy of their connection even when her form was still slumbering.

When her Spirit was separated from her slumbering form by the [[Runeblades#Thal'vyorn|Runeblade Thal'vyorn]], it was re-linked to the Soul of the sphere by [[Life|Rhajos]]' hands, for reasons unknown. Now her voice is the voice of the planet itself as the conduit of the sphere's Soul.

[[Druidic]] magic within the sacred isles is singularly Primordial, as these emanations of nature are passed to Druids that connect and commune with Sylvania's Spirit. She is known to bless beings with her Breath, granting certain benefits and boons that might aid them in carrying out her will.
