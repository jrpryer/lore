# Vespera
- [[Anar√ªl Pantheon|The Veiled One]], Mother of Trickery, giver of the Veil | Kanyiirah

The presence of pure control, absence of will, domination, dominion, and subjugation. The siphoning of effort and energy until all is swallowed in darkness. Her form as Vespera is often wrapped in grey sheets of impossibly thin silk.
  

# Thyrrakos
- The Aeon of Dominion | [[Abythras]]

As Thyrrakos, it is a towering figure encased in chains of molten amethyst, their every movement accompanied by the sound of tightening links. His gaze is piercing, exuding an oppressive aura of command. The Aeon of Dominion thrives on power dynamics, ensuring that only the strongest control the weak.
