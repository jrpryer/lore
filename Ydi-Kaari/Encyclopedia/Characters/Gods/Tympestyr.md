# The Stormbreaker
Lord of Storms and master of both alchemical transmutation and evocative conjurations, Tympestyr was the most self-assured of the [[Kanirûl Pantheon|Kanirûl]]. His attitude of entitled entertainment often landed him in opposition to the leadership of king [[Solanas]], though he often was a singular voice of distention amongst the pantheon, often failing to get his way.
