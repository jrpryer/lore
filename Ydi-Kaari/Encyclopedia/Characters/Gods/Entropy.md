# Tevros
- [[Anarûl Pantheon|The Judge of Souls]], Father of War, giver of Death | Kanyiirah

The presence tied to destruction, withering, descent, submersion, falling, and endless depths. Tevros is the patron of war and judge of the dammed on Kanyiirah, as well as the father of the lost Apathy [[Passions & Apathies#Lost Son|Destruction]].


# Mykaedra
- Final Breath, the Unmaker | [[Muérai]]

As Mykaedra, it manifests the slow spiral down, the force that pulls always deeper into the crags of Muérai. Mykaedra's touch creates unexplainable abysses—bottomless pits, unfathomable ocean trenches, or the deep gnawing sense of loss. Those who encounter it are drawn toward literal or metaphorical descent and loss, eventually succumbing to the nothingness at the bottom, at the end of all things.
