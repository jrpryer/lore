# The Heartkindler
The gentlest and most empathetic of the [[Kanirûl Pantheon|Kanirûl]], [[Lunatas]] often said she had the most tender heart in all of Greater Echnica. [[Solanas]] treated her as an adoptive daughter. On Kanyiirah, Valencia was an adviser, tender listener, confidante of the people, and figurehead of gentle service. She would often partner with [[Pyronia]] to host communal gatherings around the hearth fires of many simple folk, making her one of the most beloved household names among the people of Nashtara.

Once their palace temple of [[Ech'Yinara]] was completed, Valencia took it upon herself to handpick a diverse group of 22 like-minded servant leaders from around the isles to walk the most sacred grounds and learn from the [[Kanirûl Pantheon|Kanirûl]], so that they might take back to the people the soft skills and lessons some of the new gods and goddesses struggled to properly teach.
