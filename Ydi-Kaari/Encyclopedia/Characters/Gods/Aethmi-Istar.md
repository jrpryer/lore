#REVIEW

The mortal-made-god, an [[Cara-Dön#Cara-Dönian People|Elvi]] man of righteous living and veneration of the Mother [[Fate|Asteria]], Holy **Aesuhir** was one of the first cardinals of the [[Vólat Church]] and a deeply convicted prophet. His writings were an account of his works and discoveries, penned as instructions to mortalkind on the ways in which they should live in service to all the Vólaril. Asteria took great interest in him and seemed to entrust a great deal of wisdom to him, though all who eagerly sought to apprentice under him in the Church over the year were eventually turned away as he isolated himself more and more from the city of [[Virtue]]'s urban swell, choosing instead to live at the temple of [[Argentum]]. His prolific writing only increased, however, scribbled with a fervor that had not been seen before nor since. They were compiled within the Book of Thorns and have been distributed by the Church for their instructing and teaching every since.

After he was blessed by the will of Asteria in **120 BD**, Aesuhir ascended to a new form of minor deity, calling himself the First [[Gilded Order|Empyrean]] and changing his name to **Aethmi-Istar**. After a short time of walking in this new form, he traversed the heavens to reside in [[Lämmrus|Lusturil]] for unknown reasons. The first Cara-Dönian god to depart the sacred isles.
