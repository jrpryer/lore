### The Untamed
Also called the Eldest Druid, Taerannon was the first Khan of the [[Tashi]] river clans and mightiest of the [[Kanirûl Pantheon|Kanirûl]]. His form was near-constantly shaped to one wild beast or another, with many believing that to be his natural state, only choosing to appear humanoid for the sake of his fellow Echnicans.

Many stories told amongst the country folk of Dön feature a large primal animal of some description, with a distinct pattern of fur or antler shape that would identify it as one of Taerannon's elected forms. Therefore he is worshipped primarily by the clansmen of [[Erdö]] and the wild tribesmen of the Carain steppes; elevated as a guide and judge of character during a great hunt, he is said to watch over the land and protect his spawn of all animals and creatures that partake of the land to survive. There is a natural ebb and flow to life, as all things require one to take and give in equal amounts.

> [!recite|bg-c-gray] _It was no secret that Taerannon was quite... voracious in his lustful appetites. Most of the assorted stories amongst the [[Tashi]] tribesmen assert that he was the sire to the largest beasts that roam the isles. As a being of multiple physical forms, it is impossible to know how many partners the god took (let alone the count of singular sexual encounters), but it is recorded that his lovers amongst the humanoid races numbered only two: the Aqualii Lord Huron of great fame in [[Azentrim]], and the Carain acolyte Yui Pesh (with whom The Untamed fathered Zintzu Pesh, the founding matriarch of the Ropeshian Dynasty)_

> [!recite|bg-c-gray] _It remains unclear what connection the bloodline of Taerannon has with the current inhabitants of the Evryn isle, but his genetic influence is clear. The running theory is that some spawn of Umbravex, corrupted by [[Vault#Witnesses of the Departure|the Complex]] found their way onto those shores and violently overran the gene pools of the unique native species the Eldest Druid had sired there. The land is truly untamed now, deadly for colonists and dangerous even for intrepid procurers of its rare resources._
