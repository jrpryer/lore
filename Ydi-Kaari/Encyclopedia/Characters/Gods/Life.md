### Rhajos 
- Father of Revelry, The Herald of Delights. keeper of the [[Anarûl Pantheon#Blood|Blood Rune]] | Kanyiirah

The definition of radiance, interconnection, energy, light, life, and virility. It is the essence of will and volition. Without it, there would be no life, no comprehension of brightness, or the contrast that defines shadow. It remains the purest fragment of the harmony at the universal Origin, maintaining the luster of the first tone as it fuels the Suhns. As the one true igniter of souls and bringer of breath, Life has had a hand in the forming of many spheres, both within the Ydi-Kaari system and beyond. 

It has many forms and takes many names, as varied as the bloodlines that it has begun. To the inhabitants of Kanyiirah, it is called Rhajos, of their Anarûl pantheon. Father of the [[Passions & Apathies|Passions]] and adoptive father of the [[Passions & Apathies|Apathies]], Rhajos is the good-natured one, radiant as the green forests of Dön and vibrant as the reefs of Trivute Bay. It is in his name that the genealogies are still closely kept, as many can still trace their bloodlines back to [[Nashtara]] to this very day.

# Xëk'Liën (Liën) 
- The Echoing Radiance | Lämmrus/Suhns

 Another favored identity is Xëk'Liën, The Echoing Radiance: a generous font of Divine source magic on [[Lämmrus]], revered by the [[Vaal'k]] and other [[Ilystrin]] of the [[Gilded Order]]. As Liën, she rarely takes physical form, though she speaks with the voice of her chosen [[Archons]] and is highly involved in the rule of her sphere, defining the hierarchy and maintaining the Gilded Order amongst her devout.  
  
Ilystrin that seek to deceive or cloud the judgment of others have no place within her realm and are quickly banished. As such, it is not uncommon to find several Ilystrin scattered amongst the spheres. The worst of these offenders was a group known as the [[Drakhaën]] who were extradited from the heavenly sphere en-masse.
