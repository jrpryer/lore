Cosmic principles that exist as immortal spirits of chaos. They were 'born' at the beginning of the cosmos, erupting from the universal Origin from the harmonious chord struck at the start of existence itself. They embody the raw forces and laws of reality that shape the multiverse. Archetypal forces, demiurge essences of the concepts they embody, existing before language and thought gave them names. They are not just representations of their domains — they *are* their power, and through them, these concepts were made comprehensible to the universe. They often manifest as avatars and phenomena that influence reality across Spheres.\

{ They are the harmonic series of 6 core wavelengths and 8 chords that can exist on the range of an instrument. The number isn’t as important as the change between the notes. 
Same thing with the way electrons of an atom like to arrange themselves into discreet energy levels. Everything is quantized, patterned, ordered. There is no in-between amongst the [[Planes of Existence|planes]]. }

Of the Endless,

**Fate**: [[Fate|Asteria]] on Kanyiirah | Avæylith on [[Yggrāhkærn|Olession's Lash]]
The definition of destiny, reverberation, causality, and foresight. It is the pinnacle of cosmic knowledge and interconnectivity. Without it, the truth of what is certain would be hidden, without any hope of peaking into what can or cannot come to pass. Fate governs the endless potential paths of reality. It's domain expands into the multiverse’s infinite permutations, representing every possible future or choice. Avatars often appear as guides, oracles, tethers, or eyes, presenting mortals with crossroads that define their destinies.

**Entropy**: [[Entropy|Tevros]] on Kanyiirah | Mykaedra on [[Muérai]]
The presence tied to destruction, withering, descent, submersion, falling, and endless depths. It is the slow spiral down, the force that pulls always deeper. Mykaedra's touch creates unexplainable abysses—bottomless pits, unfathomable ocean trenches, or the deep gnawing sense of loss. Those who encounter it are drawn toward literal or metaphorical descent and loss, eventually succumbing to the nothingness at the bottom, at the end of all things.

**Life**: [[Life|Rhajos]] on Kanyirrah | Liën (Xëkliën), (aka. The Echoing Radiance) within [[Lämmrus]] and the Suhns
The definition of radiance, interconnection, energy, light, life, and virility. It is the essence of will and volition. Without it, there would be no comprehension of brightness or the contrast that defines shadow. It remains the purest fragment of the harmony at the universal Origin, maintaining the luster of the first tone as it fuels the Suhns.

**Darkness**: [[Darkness|Vespera]] on Kanyiirah | Thyrrakos on [[Abythras|Saviurn]]
The presence of pure control, absence of will, domination, dominion, and subjugation. The siphoning of effort and energy until all is swallowed in darkness. As Thyrrakos, it is a towering figure encased in chains of molten amethyst, their every movement accompanied by the sound of tightening links. Their gaze is piercing, exuding an oppressive aura of command. The Aeon of Dominion thrives on power dynamics, ensuring that only the strongest control the weak.

**Myst**: Unnamed on [[Echni|Syrisi]]
The mystical embodiment of memory, aether, transmutation, and imagination. She gave substance to the realm of Echnica, cultivating the life Rhajos propagated there and enhancing the minds and lives of all things within her domain. Hers was the most mortal-like, often manifesting in her avatar form to empathize with her charge and experience life alongside them. She was susceptible to many evils this way and eventually was so blinded by this obsession with enhancing the will of others that she could not see the threats she herself had empowered. During the civil war of Greater and Lesser Echnica, she was forcibly robbed of her infinite immortality and sealed within the ashen remnants of the Echnica World Tree, her name and history wiped from memory by her own star pupil, the High Queen [[Lunatas]].

# Fracture
Nyxia on [[Yggrāhkærn|Olession's Lash]] | the law of Flux, elsewhere in the cosmos

The essence of pure chaos, instability, division, brokenness, destabilization, rupture, and chance. A constantly shifting, amorphous entity of made of jagged, floating pieces that constantly crackle with rearranging energies. Nyxia’s voice is fragmented, like a modulation of several genders and ages speaking in discordant harmony while their form never settles into a single shape. The haunt of the shattered debris field of Olession’s Lash, flitting among the chunks of broken grey fragments of the lost world. 
	Flux especially is responsible for rejecting stability in favor of endless — sometimes violent — transformation. It is one side of the cosmic principle governing the [[Laws of True Magic]], providing the catalyst for change and the breaking of the barriers during source magic [[Laws of True Magic#Convergence|convergences]].

# Inversion
Khalthon on [[Abythras|Saviurn]] | the law of Reflection, elsewhere is the cosmos

The presence that defines reversal, immobility, opposites, and hesitance. Within the center of the planet Savuirn floats Khalthon, a statue-like figure that never moves yet exudes a presence that feels eternal. Khalthon speaks without words, conveying cryptic telepathy with any who dare approach their colossal form; a shadowy figure with no face, only the impression of features. Their presence silences all sound, yet somehow leaving one in a state of deafening clarity. It does, however, seem to enjoy breaking the careful machinations the Daemon Lords of Savuim meticulously build. 
	Reflection alternately is an ever-watchful guardian of stability and structure. It is the other side of the cosmic principle that governs the [[Laws of True Magic]], aligning the energies of a [[Laws of True Magic#Convergence|convergence]] to arrive at an anchor, regardless of its strength with it arrives. It is the order that focuses the chaos of [[#Flux]] and reverses it, creating the polarization of energy that must find purchase in a new source magic anchor.


# Fragments of an Endless
When an avatar of any Endless meets its end, the portion of Infinity that makes up it's dominion must be transformed, moved, altered, modified, or... fragmented. But no piece of Infinity can ever be truly destroyed. The Harmony that sounded at the universal Origin cannot be silenced by any law of mortals or immortals (see secrets in [[Primordial Mastery - True Naming|True Naming]])

The primary use of a 'dead', or sealed, member of the endless is to fragment their mote of Infinity and distribute it to reside in select mortal Spirits, making them functionally immortal while they posses the mote, substantially augmenting the linked Spirits and Forms that manifest in the Ethereal and Mundane planes, respectively. These immortals often rise to powerful, divine positions amongst other mortals. Most fall prey to tragedy or their own hubris and misuse of the power, having their fragment of Infinity stolen away or separated from their Spirit, reducing them again to the state of any regular mortal. Some of these even have their limited portion fragmented again to be diluted and spread over and over again. 

Though there is no precedent yet set, if all the fragments of an original mote of Infinity are once again brought together, their power can be recombined to its resolute whole. This process does not require the state of the fragments to be aligned or even of the same domain; as long as they are fragments of an original, singular member of the Endless, the mote is capable of restoration.
