# The Wyrd Aberration
Coaxed forth from a place of Wyrd shadow and cold aether by the [[Anarûl Pantheon|Anarûl]] goddess [[Vespera]], the aberration [[Titans|Titan]] called Umbravex was a tentacled crustacean of malcontent that dredged the ocean depths and hollowed new undersea cavern systems with its entropic dark energy. It carved the ocean floor between all the land masses, lingering within the spaces between Delipol and the lesser isles to create the winding, flooded caverns of [[Azentrim]] that the [[Aqualii]] would eventually call home. Deepening the strait and perforating the continental shelves with abyssal chasms to the north and east, Umbravex's darkness still lingers at the deepest depths.

It is known that Umbravex spawned many [[Leviathans|dark creatures]] as well, infecting the world with its strange blood and twisted aspirations.
  
Many believe the [[Eternal Maelstrom]] to be the location of Umbravex's death at the hands of an enraged [[Tympestyr]].
