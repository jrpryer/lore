# The Arcane Colossus
The four-armed Arcane giant of legend was the greatest of all the [[Titans]], capable of sculpting mountains and carving valleys with his mighty hands. His form towered over all, his footsteps echoing but not cratering the land unless he intended it. He worked with the perfect control of an artist's hand, laying the foundations of the sacred isles with dogged, unwavering intent.
