> ~ "The Eternally Enflamed" ~

- Dra- ~ Root derived from nara (fire). This prefix implies a deeper, fiery essence or temper; restless and unquenching.
- -kha- ~ Derived from kûra (body), implying embodiment or physicality
- -ën ~ A suffix often denoting continuity or eternity, marking something timeless in [[Lustrálian]].

All Drakhaën were once [[Lämmrus#Ilystrin Society|Ilystrin]] that became feverishly driven to grasp power for themselves. They were a faction of Ilystrin mystics that called themselves the **Narithalë**, "Keepers of the Enlightened Flame". But their hubris led them to be bound to physical forms and forced to flee to [[Kanyiirah]]. They fell through its skies like burning comets, coming to be submerged in its cool southern oceans, never again to return to their home as [[Souls, Spirits, Forms#Greater Spirits|Greater Spirits]].

# History
Called "Dragons" in the common Trade languages — or "fiends" in other parts of the world that have been infused with their blood — the Drakhaën were once wise and cunning Ilystrin spirits from [[Lämmrus]] that bore strong affinities for controlling their Arcane source magic. They were the Narithalë sect, the most curious, studious, and learned amongst the Ilystrin, which made their temptation for new knowledge quite easy for the daughters of [[Aethmi-Istar]] to manipulate and enflame. Two powerful [[Vaal'k|Vaal'kuhrea]] — **Anílanthë** and **Zýrathar** ― encouraged this group to experiment with high magic that they all believed should be easy to wield by Greater Spirits such as themselves.

These Narithalë were reckless and ignorant of the powers they toyed with, discovering potent [[Arcane#Mastery|Words of Power]] that nearly killed the invokers and gathered the ire of The Echoing Radiance [[Life|Xëk'Liën]], who saw their exploits as heretical to the law of her established [[Gilded Order]]. And so with a heavy heart, she judged the members of the Narithalë with a Convergence, burdening them with forms befitting their misguided aspirations, cursed by their own hubris and naming them Drakhaën, "The Eternally Enflamed". 

During the fusion of their Arcane-anchored spirits and Xëkliën's [[Primordial#Mastery|Primordial True Naming]], the source magic of each Drakhaën was rotated, as per the [[Laws of True Magic|First Law of True Magic]]: half were linked to a newly acquired source of Divine magic, while the other half were tethered to twisting Wyrd source magic.

Now bound in flesh and unable to bear the heat of the Lämmrussian surface, the newly named Drakhaën were forced to flee. When the Vaal'kuhrea came to claim their prize, they too were judged by [[Life|Liën]] and twisted into beautifully tragic shadows of their former selves. Spited and bitter, the two new [[Shaedriël]] led the Drakhaën in a desperate and hasty exodus from the radiant Sphere. They brought the great host to the threshold of the [[Kanyiirah|Kanyiiran]] orbit and took them down to the icy waters of the southern oceans in a fiery blaze of tremendous spectacle. The stargazers of Duhn reported it as the "greatest stellar phenomenon in recorded history; streaks of light and fire blazing overhead for several unbroken, spectacular minutes."

## Further Splinted
The [[Shaedriël]] then found themselves in disagreement regarding the direction each wished to take the fledgling Drakhaën race next: Zýrathar saw great benefit in the Drakhaën collecting together and building a society of their own, one that could even rival the land of Cara-Duhn so favored by the gods of this world. They would build great fonts of power and take to the skies, expanding the capacity of all nations tenfold with the sharing of their collective Arcane knowledge.  
Anílanthë on the other hand, believed in the strength of the new draconic forms that each great spirit now possessed, predicting that a single prepared Drakhaën would soon be capable of crushing and dominating territory the size of Cara alone. She believed that spreading the young Drakhaën to every corner of the Sphere was the only way to ensure they dominated and thrived.  
In the end, the former Vaal'kuhrea went their separate ways, with Zýrathar leading those metallic Drakhaën that drew Divine power, and Anílanthë leading away the chromatic faction of Drakhaën that were empowered by the source of Wyrd magic. 

# Drakhaën Hierarchy
## Zy'kryn
The greatest of Zýrathar's divine-touched Drakhaën — called the "Zy’kryn" — is called the **Zholkrath**
	Zhol: "sacred", or "holy". Krath: "Defender", "protector", or "guardian", directly tying the title to divinity and the celestial past of the Drakhaën.  

## An'kryn
Anílanthë's strongest and foremost champion of the wyrd-bound "An’kryn" Drakhaën is called the **Dévalkar**, (lit. "Breaker of the Divine")
	Dév:  A harshened version of dē, now pronounced with a more guttural tone, meaning "divine" or "celestial" but with an edge of power or fallen divinity. Alkar: In [[Draconic]], alkar evolved from karak (“to take”) and karn (“strength”), emphasizing domination or possession.

# Civilization and Culture
Languages: [[Draconic]], an adapted form of [[Lustrálian]]

## Interspecies Relations
One young Zy'kryn Drakhaën named [[Fyrekka]] managed to follow the [[Aurelyn]] and the trail left by [[Caelaistra]] to descend over the [[Eternal Maelstrom|Mists of Dolos]] and alight upon [[Lesser Isles#Subasa|Subasa Isle]]. Biding her time until the wars of the Thinning were over and the [[University Towards Enlightened Truth|UTET]] was established, she has only recently made her presence known to the faculty of the University.

#REVIEW 
The creation of [[Kobolds]] by the Drakhaën is a hard truth of the race displaying them as victims of cruelty, bound to serve and suffer under their creators. This dynamic introduces a stark contrast between them and the [[Draktharun]] genetic descendants, with the Kobolds possibly seeing the Draktharun as inheritors of power they were denied.

maybe kobolds groups find themselves protected by wyverns, buddying up in pseudo families like the greater dragons do with their Dreakun ancestors? (Idea still undercooked)
