The language of [[Sylvania]], unique to the land, both depth and breadth, of the [[Cara-Duhn|sacred isles]]. 
Even the most dumb beasts can understand basic concepts communicated in this language. 

Additionally, fauna and flora that are instilled with [[Sylvania|Sylvania's breath]] or find themselves in the vicinity of her most potent auras gain the ability to read and write Druidic (to the best of their Form's ability). Though, the Verdant Titan does allow these abilities to last long.
%%, beasts blessed with this higher acuity for periods of years at a time do exist, often maintaining the appearance of their original dumbed selves and brethren for their own safety. %%
