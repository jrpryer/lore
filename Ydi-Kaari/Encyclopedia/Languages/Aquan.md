The language of the [[Aqualii]] people, uniquely suited for carrying underwater. The language incorporate swimming patterns and hand signals to communicate quickly and silently when the need arises. Because of this, few other species have gotten the opportunity to truly master it.

It is a flowing, rhythmic language with long vowels, soft fricatives, and glottal stops.

- Many words have a "bubbling" or "rippling" quality due to repeating syllables and diphthongs.
- Uses tonal inflection to convey subtle emotional nuances.
- Consonants like **h, zh, s, k, and l** are prominent, evoking the sensation of currents or waves.
