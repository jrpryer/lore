In the absence of the [[Kanirûl Pantheon]], there rose several religious followings, dedicated to many different makeups of the available pantheons, but eventually, most Cara-Dönians fell into one of three major camps: the [[Vólat Church]], the [[#Thraev'gal Pact]], or the [[#Kindleheart Concordia]]. They each quickly compiled the key teachings the deities had left behind and set about spreading these tenets back to the nations to teach their offspring, should the gods ever return and find favor with the way their devout had lived in their absence. 

Certain heritages may have a particular affinity towards one doctrine over others.

# Kindleheart Concordia
The [[Constellations]] are core to the beliefs of the Kindleheart Concordia, though are also given adoration by the basic spiritual makeup of Cara-Dönian culture; while the organized religions will venerate the gods of the two Vólaril pantheons in their own ways, devotees of all walks of life may find themselves worshiping the Mothers and Fathers under specific constellations, with members of the Concord taking it even further to praise the gifts of the [[Kanirûl Pantheon|Echnicans]] under these signs as well.

Some devotees have begun to equate the myths of Greater Echnica with the early stories of Lusturil, blending beliefs of the Mother Asteria, the elevation of Aethmi-Istar, and the new Vólat-rah orthodoxy into a simple fledgling belief that the Kanirûl were 'starborn' children from the [[Lämmrus|Radiant Halls]], walking the land and teaching mortals the way to commit their own souls to the stars when they die.

Consequently, there are many ways divine faith is practiced in Kanyiirah. For instance, a Life Cleric might follow the tenets of the Kanirûl goddess [[Valencia]] just as easily as another might worship the [[Passions & Apathies|Passion]] Ecstasy, the Anarûl Father [[Life|Rhajos]], or— The Dreamweaver, [[Lunatas]], but only when the [[Constellations#Harp of Theyton|Harp of Theyton]] is in [[Constellations|majør]]

Often times people associate the first chosen 22 servants of [[Valencia]]'s retinue to hold sacred meaning, divining certain omens from cards touched by a persons blood, drawing impressions of fate from the distant favored daughter of the Suhns and Moons:

# Thraev'gal Pact
It is the Thraev'gal Pact that poses the greatest threat to those who profess faith in the [[Kanirûl Pantheon]], as proselytizers of this doctrine openly encourage violence against all Echnican devotees. They believe the [[Titans]] to be the holy offspring of the original Fathers and Mothers of the sphere, often sacrificing their bodies in twisted ways to profess their faith in hopes of directly drawing favor from the spirits of the Titans or even the Anarûl themselves.

Members of this pact embrace the [[Passions & Apathies]], revering the celestial [[Aethmi-Istar]] as a paternal figure, and so vehemently reject the [[Vólat Church#Current|Vólat elevation]] of his Book of Thorns, calling out the perversions done to its original text. They constantly seek to destroy or spirit away the [[Runeblades]] and in every way oppose the Kanirûl, viewing the closeness those lesser gods had with mortalkind as a weakness all mortals should be ashamed of.

One small sect of this organization were direct converts from the Vólat Church; pilgrims who had visited the remains of [[Ech'Yinara]] and adopted the belief that the [[Kanirûl Pantheon|Kanirûl]] would only return once all their children had turned away from them in worship. This hope that the absence of faith and adoration might finally cause their gods' return fuels them in their careful planning and heinous acts of violence to dismantle the Church, all while offering them an out of mental disassociation and false moral high ground as they murder those they once prayed alongside in cold blood.

# Occult
There were writings of the [[Idanthi]] found within the northern-most ruins of Evryn that offered nothing to their earliest finders, but that were sent to remain in the record halls of the Ropeshian monarchs. Many years later, scholars reviewed these writings with new eyes and found patterns and etchings of the most esoteric nature... they spoke of unknown gods, rudimentary chemistry, nautical chartings, and most heritical of all, arts of divinations. By the time mortalkind was caught up enough in the sciences and teachings of the Kanirûl to put the teachings of the writings into practice, the devout of the Vólat Church denounced them as nothing more than vague hopes and mysticisms of the occult... And though the language structure of the Idanthi became somewhat of a hobby for linguists and historians, the secrets of those works were buried and modern research into their applications entirely forbidden....

Through careful study, a fraternity of [[University Towards Enlightened Truth|UTET]] alumni — 4 of a Cosmology dedication and 3 of the Heurism dedication — took it upon themselves to decipher the secrets of the texts and see if their eyes could be opened to new possibilities of divine arts. What they discovered however, broke most of their minds and sent the rest into fits of emotion that none could cure. For while the majority of the Idanthi texts were of a strictly scientific nature, there were mixed within them esoteric rituals of [[Laws of True Magic|Convergent]] Wyrd experiments that promised sight, knowledge, and connection to higher realms of thought. 

These actions, when performed by the Carain and Ropeshian researchers, temporarily connected them to the overwhelming will of beings existing beyond this mundane world: Daemonic lords of singular testament that had originally hid their machinations deep within the rituals of the Idanthi that first penned them into the forbidden manuscripts. These plans had been made with specific Idanthi in mind, however when performed by these dogmatic scholars, their mixed and exotic lineages failed to take, leaving behind scarred minds rather than fully enslaved ones. Still, the damage was done, and the [[Daemons]] of [[Abythras]] became newly aware of the curious mortals that had been expertly shrouded from their sight by the divine [[Eternal Maelstrom|Mists of Dolos]].
