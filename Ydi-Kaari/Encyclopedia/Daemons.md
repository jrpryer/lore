> [!recite|bg-c-blue] “The bodies were stacked 4 meters high in the trenches under the broken walls, choking the fissures as our war golems rolled over them. Many suffocated in the smoke or were pressed down into the blooded mud. Those that managed to escape our flanking hammer leaked into the anvil of the city, where they were hunted down by Ghanji’s Frenzied defenders like rats. I could not stop the bloodshed even if I wanted to. Driven mad by the enemy spellstorms, cyrospike bombardement, and Rift crossing, my Daemon Criis sever any creed they once possessed as they butcher our would-be slavers. Those unlucky enough to be cornered can do nothing but add their corpses to the bulwarks of the dead.”

# History
#REVIEW {Malzan's book of the Fallen}
Daemons are **not beings with a soul** — they are manifestations of the neighboring forces of magic; the wounding power of Wyrd and the ordering power of Arcane given shape through endless warfare and sacrifice.

The Daemon Principes are not normal beings. Unlike mortals of Kanyiirah, the Fae of [[Echni]], or the Celestials of [[Lämmrus]], the dominate beings of Abythras are themselves coalesced manifestations of Arcane and Wyrd source magics. These **Emanations** begin as powerful Daemon Lords that transcend their mortal state through secret rituals of conflict-born ideologies given shape by war, ambition, and thought. 
%% 
By gathering the belief of their subjects and capturing their mental attention, a Daemon Lord is capable of becoming the catalyst of at a site of massive [[Family of the Endless#Inversion|inversion]], being transmuted into a living belief; a war-born concept of how the Daemon Lord is perceived by the lesser beings bound to it and made into a 'living' force. The Emanation consumes the Daemon Lord host and emerges from the collective, constant force of wills from the masses, eventually becoming self-sustained by their memories, fears, and shared desires. In essence, each Daemon Principe is an unbound [[Laws of True Magic#Convergence|convergence]], layered upon the mental energies of its subordinates until it attains its own self-awareness.

Daemon Lords that have discovered this secret and may seek to attain such a state themselves must be very careful to not draw the suspicion of the Principe they are pledged do. Over time, they must solidify their dominion of a great horde, best done by consuming rival ideologies, eliminating competing beliefs, and imposing their desired reality upon their own subordinates. The birth of a Daemon Principe is a monumental event; a victory marking the end to many anxious years of painstaking efforts and secrecy. %% 

Daemon Principe Emanations differ from Greater Spirits in key ways:
1. **No Soul Anchor** – They are not tethered to a soul, meaning they are unkillable in a conventional sense. Destroying their form only disperses their essence, which will eventually reconstitute.
2. **Multiple Forms, Not Just One** – Because they are not bound by the limits a singular soul, Daemon Lords can have many forms, or vessels, at once. They can easily traverse across Abythras and some even seek to traverse the vast distance to Kanyiirah, bleeding into the Mundane and Ethereal planes.
3. **War Begets War** – Their will is dictated the original Daemon Lord host that transcended itself. They crave conflict because conflict sustains them. If a Daemon Principe ceases to struggle, they begin to unravel.

## Lesser Daemons
These beings are the mortal inhabitants of Abythras, made of flesh and spirit; and unlike their masters, they can eventually die, if ripped apart enough times. These are spirits who chose or were pulled into servitude to the Daemon Lords, bound by the laws of rebirth on Abythras.

Some spirits ― whether from Kanyiirah, Echni, or other worlds — fall into Abythras' Wyrd-wounded Aether well and are reshaped entirely by its magics. These are the truly tragic daemons: beings who once had souls, identities, and purpose but had them stripped away, being utterly changed by the war-torn nature of the plane. Some were captured in this way, others were spirits who came seeking power, and some simply stumbled into a fate far worse than death. Each lesser daemon is unique in form, dictated by the magic that birthed them.

Slaves to the chaos of the Abythratic wars, these daemons are forced into servitude, bound by:
- **Survival** – A daemon who does not fight, serve, or align with a Lord will eventually be consumed. Abythras is not a place of peace, and without the stabilizing force of a Daemon Lord’s dominion, they will either be consumed by another faction or fade into entropy.
- **Belief** – Many truly believe their Daemon Prince or Lord is the rightful ruler of Abythras and that their war is just. Even if their battles are eternal, they _matter_ in the eyes of their god-like masters.
- **The War Itself** – Some daemons come to _need_ the war. Their forms are so steeped in conflict that peace is an alien concept. To stop fighting would mean losing themselves. In this way, they are **prisoners of their own war**, eternally bound to an existence they may not want, but cannot abandon. 
- **The War Is All They Have** – If a daemon refuses to fight, they are hunted down by their own kin, driven by the dominating, subjugating will of the Abyssal laws. There is no life outside the chains of their commanders. Some daemons may even remember being something _else_ before being cast into the form of a newly born daemon, making their fate all the more horrifying. Even the greatest Archdaemons must fight, not because they want to, but because stopping would mean ceasing to exist.

### Archdaemons
First among the mortal-bound lesser daemons and apex survivors of the wars, these are the luitenents of the Daemon Lords and chief executioners of their grand visions. 

## Unnatural Rebirth
in **220 BD,** 30 years before the Kanyiiran event called [[Nashtara]], the [[#Draezhir]] Daemon Lord **Zaurath**, the Fleshcarver, desired to forge a perfected slave race to serve his Daemonic Principe as fuel to the grinder of their war machines. He descended to Kanyiirah to kidnap [[Idanthi]] who would be the catalysts of his new venture and brought them to Maevelis' throne city of [[Abythras#Cities|Tiefratus]]. Through brutal [[Wyrd]] experimentation he conducted a series of [[Laws of True Magic|Convergences]], using the [[Arcane]] cores of several slain [[#Cyndralis]] champions as his anchor. With the fanatical devotion of the truest Draezhir deviant, the Daemon Lord of Blood twisted every fiber of those Idanthi captives into something new through his dark rituals. Slowly, subtly, he altered their forms, harmonized their spirits, scarred their very souls until, he had perfected a new [[SECRETS#True Laws of True Magic|Instinctual]] form of life, born of [[Abythras]]: the first [[_Lineages|Tieflings]].

## Syraphite
'Angel' is a word used by Kanyiirans as an honorific to the [[Vaal'k|celestial children]] of [[Aethmi-Istar]] and [[Valencia]]. The Daemon Principe **[[#Zlaaz'ek]]** — Wielder of SunEater, Most Unmerciful, Great Dethroner and first among the Lords of Hellfire — used this to her advantage, kidnapping several Ilystrin that had taken physical form and sealing them with vile blood curses to twist their bodies and alter their minds, breaking their wills to serve the Lords of Hellfire alone. This birthed the fiendish **Syraphite**, or "Dark Angels": daemons of fair form and complexion that resemble the holy figures of [[Lämmrus|Lusturil]] to charm and beguile mortalkind into serving as cultists in profane, heretical rituals that empower the Lords of Hellfire directly.

### Blind Priests
Among the Syraphite are the Blind Priests, beings of unholy light that coerce worship from the devout and punish the unfaithful.

"The first time I saw a Blind Priest, I had assumed I had found a devil corrupting a temple. I could sense the illusion from my time combating deception, but what I saw with my eyes was a blind man walking through rows of prostrated followers with a soft smile on his lips. There was one follower who was not praying. Perhaps his faith was shaken, or perhaps he was simply scared, but this blind priest calmly knelt before him, placed his hands on the man's cheeks, and pressed his forehead to his. In that moment, I saw for a brief moment, the true form of this angel; warped limbs strung together by pallid light with bone and flesh strung over the eyes. Wild and impossibly smooth hair that clung to its body and rested on surfaces in the air that did not exist. It was only for a moment, before I saw that priest fall to the ground, and the "blind man" continue to walk amongst the followers. The rest prayed, while the blood of the sinner pooled at their feet, and soaked their robes."

### Silenced Chorus
#REVIEW 
- **Description**: Veiled figures whose mouths have been fused over with a slick, pale membrane. Behind the flesh-seal glows a crimson brand that unleashes haunting, wordless chanting.
- **Role**: They gather crowds and enthrall them with unspoken psalms, the vibrations of which stir madness or dark ecstasy in mortals. Their silent chanting can lull entire villages into a trance-like worship or drive them to frenzy.
- **Ritual Style**: The Choir forms circles around altars, emanating dissonant hums that can crack stone or warp the minds of those who dare approach.

### Riven Oracles
#REVIEW
- **Description**: Seraphic creatures bearing large, contorted wings. Their eyes are permanently pinned open by bone-shards, forcing them to perpetually witness both mortal reality and the eldritch darkness of the Astral Expanse.
- **Role**: They prophesy doom and terror, foretelling cataclysms or identifying potential sacrificial “heretics.” Their visions often manifest in disturbing illusions that torment entire congregations.
- **Unique Power**: Riven Oracles can physically _hurl_ the terrors they witness into the minds of others, causing horrific waking nightmares.

### Faceless Penitents
#REVIEW
- **Description**: Emaciated, robed figures with featureless masks grafted to their skulls. Black ichor seeps from the edges of the mask, hinting at the agonized visage underneath.
- **Role**: They serve as a punishing arm of the Sanguine Seraphim, dragging away suspected traitors or unbelievers under the cover of darkness.
- **Disturbing Trait**: Penitents moan softly through the mask’s slits, uttering half-recognizable pleas for release. Their constant, maddening murmurs can unsettle even other daemons.
