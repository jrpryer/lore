Resolute and noble, Hobgoblins are broad-shouldered, hairy, bipedal humanoids. The color of their manes sometimes gives clues as to a particular Hobgoblin’s heritage and nationality.

Hobgoblins hold themselves to high standards of ancient military honor. Their lineage has a long history of warfare, as it was they that bled first in [[the Thinning]] wars. They fought on all sides of the war, taking orders from those in power to crush any and all foes. Now, this history is recorded and retold to keep the knowledge fresh for new generations to learn and grow from, in whatever form the individual might take.

When hobgoblins aren’t fighting, they farm, they build, and they practice meditative martial arts.

**Honor the Path**. Beauty is in their culture is associated with the perfection of skill. The iron grip that philosophy holds on their hearts blinds hobgoblins to accomplishments, be that of their own people or of others. They leave little space for leisure in their lives and thus their culture has no reserve of faith to call upon when in dire straits; better to be defeated in pursuit of highest ideals than rest on one's haunches and wait for a lazy death.

**Uphold the Legion**. These trappings of civil society barely manage to tame the underlying brutality that hobgoblins once practiced on each other and perfected upon other races. Punishment for infractions of hobgoblin law are swift and merciless. Cowardice is more terrible to hobgoblins than dying, for they carry their living acts into the afterlife. A hero in death becomes a hero eternal.

**Reward Glorious Action.** Hobgoblins never deny advancement in status to a individual that has earned it. If a legion "banner" attains great glory in battle but is nearly destroyed, the handful of members who remain are welcomed into another banner, taking their banner’s name and colors along with them, and assuming places of leadership in the group.

**Suffer nor Give Insult.** As befits their warlike past, hobgoblins believe that any insult demands a response. Suitably (and somewhat ironically), the outward politeness and civility that they demonstrate among each other enables them to avoid conflicts in daily life. This same form of “courtesy” is often extended to other races the hobgoblins have dealings with, much to the outsiders’ surprise. When such respect isn’t reciprocated, though, relations can swiftly deteriorate.

Hobgoblins often hail from the cold climates of the Frozen Peaks, standing against both the challenging environment and more fearsome neighbors with their might.

# Traits
Your Hobgoblin character has certain hereditary traits dictated by their lineage:
**Age**. Hobgoblin reach adulthood in their late teens, living up to 80 years. 
**Size**. Your size is Medium. Hobgoblin are typically large and muscular, reaching a height of over 7 feet and weighing anywhere between 200 and 300 pounds.
**Speed**. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. 
**Saving Face**. When you make a CHA check, you can add your STR or CON modifier to it (choose which during character creation). You can use this trait a number of times equal to your PB, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
**Martial Training**. You and allied creatures within 5 feet of you have advantage on saves against becoming frightened while you are conscious and not incapacitated. 

# Variants
## Wilding
During the chaos of [[the Departure]], a swathe of the Hobgoblin population was infected with a vile blood curse that shriveled their bodies, stripped them of nearly all their hair, and weakened their bones. And as is often the nature of [[Wyrd]] dark magic, this curse increased the libido of the survivors, driving them to pass on these altered traits to their offspring.

Now overly fecund and adaptable, vast populations of these Hobgoblin Wildings — often simply called "**Goblins**" — can be found nearly everywhere creatures can survive. Despite their numbers, goblins aren’t known for building great cities. Their settlements tend to be small and purpose-built to incorporate the natural environment. A region is likely to have several settlements with dozens of active alliances and rivalries between them.

Goblins are also comfortable living in large cities where they form unruly communities, often in undesirable neighborhoods. They happily work at occupations that others shy away from, such as tending middens or rat catching.

During [[the Thinning]], goblins warred with the Elvi and Oread, often used as shock troops for [[Urik]] or [[Hobgoblin]] warlords. This history causes them to be viewed with suspicion, if not hostility, though this view is has decreased over time as they continue to prove they are industrious and conscientious neighbors.

Goblins are short and tend to be slim with ropey musculature and slightly oversized heads. They have skin tones ranging widely from gray through yellow, depending on their native environment, but most tend to varying shades of green.
