- [[Idanthi]] - (Human) hardy, adaptable people with highly variable skin tones, builds, and features based on heritage and environment. Quick to innovate and even quicker to reproduce
	- Ifrit variant - hardy, tanned, desert-dwelling

- Hrüthgarn - (Goliaths, Giantkin) tall, cantankerous, and superstitious people that mark their bodies with [[Leviathans|Leviathan]] ink and pierce their noses with thin bones. A mix of Mongolian, South Pacifica, and Norse influences. ^de0f1a
	- The descendants of the [[Yggrāhkærn#Colossi|Colossi]] from [[Yggrāhkærn]]. Castaways that fight tooth and nail to avoid being driven into extinction by the [[Idanthi]] reavers that mark this continent as their prison isle. They fight like mad Vikings when pushed too far.

# Present at Nashtara
- [[Aqualii]] - (Beastkin, Aquatic - Merfolk) aquatic, scaled, amphibious. These are old souls, traditional people that often view those who dwell in the mountains and canyons of the greater isles as lesser inheritors of the walking gods' domain.

- [[Oread]] - (Dwarves) stout crafters, stony, stoic folk
	- Ifrit variant - fiery, chitinous, desert-dwelling

- [[Smallfolk]] - plucky, inquisitive folk, split into two main adaptations:
	- [[Smallfolk#Halfling|Halfling]] - nomadic, caravan farmers
	- [[Smallfolk#Gnome|Gnome]] - quite small, urban inventors

- [[Elvi]] - (Elves) graceful, magical, logical. The most versatile of the races at Nashtara.
	- [[Elvi#Ganzi|Ganzi]] variant - (Syderean, Fey - God-touched, Aasimar) instinctual, pale, reincarnated

- [[Urik]] - (Orcs) Forged in the fires of conflict. Uriks often revel in testing their strength against worthy foes. Displaced by wars, most are wanderers who search to restore the glory of their once-great heritage, from before the Departure
 
- [[Strix]] - (Beastkin, Avian) monastic isolationist, flighted avians. Their fascination with collecting and protecting esoteric knowledge is one of the few things that can persuade them to explore the outside world. They are slender of body and spiritually attuned. Many are nocturnal as well.

- [[Hobgoblin]] - ingenuitive, imperialistic, strategic
	- [[Hobgoblin#Wilding|Wilding]] variant - (Goblin) crafty, pyromaniacal, chaos-loving

- [[Alseid]] - (Centaurs) quick, shamanistic explorers

- [[Nagaji]] - (Lizardfolk) short of stature, spiritually willful

- [[Kitsune]] - (Beastkin, Agile) foxlike, shapeshifting, mischievous

- [[Ghoran]] - (Beastkin, Sturdy) floral, nature guardian, cultivated

- [[Tieflings|Tiefling]] - (Syderean, Fiendish) social, expressive, horned entertainers. Descendants of unknown Wyrd experimentations, Tieflings come in many different colors, with three distinct patterns that have emerged: #REVIEW 
	- [[Tieflings#Chthonic]] variant - Horns that flare outward or curl to the sides, colors ranging from dark blue to smoky green, bearing tails that barb once or twice at the tip.
	- [[Tieflings#Devilish]] variant - Horns that stretch upward or slick back, colors ranging from a copper red to muted pink, bearing tails that flare at the tip.
	- [[Tieflings#Daemonic]] variant - Horns that jut forward or curl downward, colors ranging from dark gray to stained yellow, bearing tails that fork at least once at the tip.

> [!recite|bg-c-gray] _After the Thinning, several groups found their numbers severely diminished, to the point where encountering them in today's age in almost a rarity. Though their pride runs deep and their memories long-lasting, you would be hard pressed to find any large communities of Nagaji, Urik, or Strix, and even less likely you'd encounter even just a handful of Kitsunes or Ghoran._

# Post-Nashtaran Emergences:
- Vampyrs - the immortal descendants of [[Fate of the Heartkindler|Rathus]] and his ilk that underwent the [[Laws of True Magic|Second Law Convergence]] that transformed them into their final monstrous, [[SECRETS#True Laws of True Magic|Instinctual]] forms, Vampyrs — or **vampires** — are a rare sub-species of Elvi within Cara-Duhn, despised by the general populace of the [[Ropeshian Dynasty]] but quietly revered by the nobles of the [[Vólatian Theocracy]]. Their existence was born of a dark event, but 4 of the 5 vampire families all swore life-long oaths to the doctrine of the Vólat Church and now hold high positions in the Theocracy leadership, having fully supported the shift in Vólat-rah orthodoxy as well.
	- The remaining [[SECRETS#The 5th Family|5th family]] remained isolated from civilization after [[the Thinning]]

- [[Draktharun]] - (Dragonborn) diverse, scaled, notorious, and loyal. Chosen of the mortal races and forged new bodies by the magic of the Drakhaën, Draktharun are smaller, more humanoid forms of their mighty creators, sporting the wings, spikes, tails, and scales of their master. Draktharun are nearly sterile, the males incapable of siring children for any other race to bear, and females only capable of bearing Wilding offspring. #REVIEW 
	- Wilding variant - (Kobold) small, witty, inventive. Immediate descendants of Draktharun that carry none of the bodily majesties of their parentage, seemly having lost many of the gifts the mighty Drakhaën bestowed on their bloodline. #REVIEW 

- Aens'hel - (Syderean, Celestial) vibrant, charismatic, passionate, sporting metallic or iridescent skin tones. Children born from a union of any one of the mortal races and a [[Vaal'k]] descendent of the mortal-made-god [[Aethmi-Istar]] himself, most often sired by a Vaal'korr though rarely borne by a Vaal'kuhrea. However, The Echoing Radiance [[Life|Xëkliën]] forbids the birth of Kanyiirans within her realm, so all Aens'hels are forced to walk upon a sphere they know was never made to be their true home.
