Now, I was also heavily inspired by the Pathfinder 2E Goloma. So ideally, the Kanyiiran Ghoran would be cultivated beings, created by the Titan Sylvania as the only natural inhabitants of Evryn and Duhn before Nashtara brought the birth of the many species. They experience emotion almost like a synesthete experiences sound, connected through the breath of Kanyiirah to the soul of their Titan creator. They were the first to whom Sylvania taught Druidic. In the early days of their existence, and around the time of Nashtara, Ghoran were brightly mottled, boasting bright floral colors and sinewy bodies of lithe, plant-like structure. As time went on and their Gleamwood began to be settled by Alsied and Nagaji, their colors became more muted and their bodies more solid for labor and construction. Some were even trained in the art of defensive combat by Solanas himself. Those that were chosen by the Kanirûl to travel and reside at Ech'Yinara felt, for the first time, accepted by this new generation of beings, seeing their presence and trust kept by these new gods as a tight bond between their old world and this new one. _That_ is why they were so devout; not out of a sense of religious faith, but of a much deeper _need_ to be anchors of their world. The eroding of that trust reached its pinnacle after the last Ghoran was slain in Ech'Yinara, with no sight or hope of a Kanirûl return. Mechanically, they _almost_ fit the playstyle of a DnD Warforged or Pathfinder Automaton. Though they are beings of wood, plant fiber, and flora, not of metal; having slowly grown more distant, reclusive, and quiet, these stout guardians of the verdant land are some of the rarest inhabitants one can encounter in the Sacred Isles now. Though, they are not fully extinct. In the quiet, open glens of southern Duhn, merchant sailors may yet be treated with the sight of a Ghoran sentinal, standing watch on the edges of the Gleamwood, bearing its heavy wooden arms above its head in silent reverence to the Verdant Titan, holding strong to a hidden hope that the legacy of its people will not go forgotten.


# Kanyiirah Lore
Ghoran were never overly numerous to begin with, mostly keeping to themselves in the Gleamwood even when the gods walked the isles. They were viewed as favored by the Kanirûl, since many of their lineage had been invited to live amongst the gods at the seat of their power in the condorium of Ech'Yinara.

Ghoran were already so few in number that those who died in self-defense during the Thinning were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time; Ech'Yinara was a bastion of the gods that was ransacked first by desperate zealots, then greedy thieves, then starved refugees of the wars. Ghoran are mysterious, but very emotional beings, holding out the longest in hope of the Kanirûl's return.

PINEY
Many villages scattered through the Margreve Forest are
home to an elusive lineage of Humanoids known as the
pineys. They follow a code known by most as “the Old
Ways,” but for them, these rules of the forest are as natural
as the leaves growing on the boughs above.
While the pineys were once human, their bodies have
been changed by the magic of the great forest over many
generations. When a piney leaves the Margreve Forest,
the forest’s influence fades but never fully disappears.
Their too-long limbs and blank inchoate eyes suggest a
fey influence, but their kind is mostly known for strange
plant-like qualities to their skin, hair, and nails. Though
these plant-like aspects manifest in different ways for each
piney, all pineys appear genderless, the forest’s power
removing differences between male and female in favor of
plant features. When two pineys want to reproduce, they
do so via spores, typically shed from their bark-like skin or
leaf-like hair.
Some elder pineys in the deepest parts of the forest
exhibit very strong plant-like aspects, often appearing
closer to a treant than a human. Most pineys, however,
appear humanoid with plant-like features.
LIFE IN THE FOREST
Piney villages are located deep in the Margreve Forest.
Though their homes evoke human architecture, the villages
are often melded into the trunks of trees or dug into the
side of grassy hills. From these enclaves, pineys patrol
their territory from dusk until sunrise ensuring the woods
are safe and free from interlopers. Pineys feed through
photosynthesis, which often requires them to chase
patches of sunlight throughout the day before returning to
their villages for a few hours of rest.
PINEY TRAITS
Your piney character has the following hereditary traits.
Age. Pineys reach adulthood in their late teenage years
and typically live to be just over 100 years old.
Size. Your size is Medium or Small. Pineys vary widely
in height but tend to have sturdy builds with bark-like
growths. They range from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet
tall and average around 175 pounds. If you choose to play a
piney shorter than 4 feet however, you can choose your size
to be Small.
Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
Hybrid Humanoid. Though your type is Humanoid,
you have traits in common with Plants. You have
advantage on saves against effects that would cause you
to become exhausted. In addition, you have advantage
on saves against being paralyzed or petrified and against
effects that would make you fall unconscious.
Living Wood. In moments of peril, you can rapidly grow
tough bark, vines, or similar growth to shield you from
harm. When an attacker you can see would hit you with a
melee attack, you can use your reaction to increase your
AC by an amount equal to your PB against the triggering
attack. You can use this trait a number of times equal to
your PB, and you regain all expended uses when you finish
a long rest.
Photosynthetic. If you spend at least 1 hour in an area
of sunlight or natural bright light, your daily food
requirements are met (see Starvation and Dehydration
in the Player’s Guide). In addition, if you spend the entirety
a short rest in such an area, you can regain a number of
expended hit dice up to your PB. Once you recover hit dice
in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

PINEY CHARACTERS
Though pineys appear mostly human, they possess many
plant-like characteristics. When making a piney character,
decide how the Margreve Forest’s influence on your bloodline
manifests itself in your physical form. Here are some physical
characteristics your character might have:
• Your skin is rough with harmless cracks resembling
tree bark.
• Heavily-perfumed flowers grow wherever your body hair
is dense. They can be plucked, but they grow back
within a few days.
• Your eyes are twice as large as typical human’s, and
their color is a changing swirl of green, orange, and
brown.
• Your finger and toe nails are wood.
• Your major joints (shoulders, hip, knees)
creak like tree branches when you move.



# Potential Template: ToV Dryad

DRYAD
The lands of the fey, whether they are
called the Summer Lands, Wall Beyond,
the Plane of the Fey, or simply Faerie,
are lush with thick, dark forests.
Growing in these forests are innumerable
heart trees, each of which serves as a dryad’s home
and soul. To the casual eye, a heart tree looks like any
other tree of its species, but a practiced observer can tell the
difference between it and a mundane tree at a glance. Heart
trees are slightly smaller than average, and they never show
signs of pest infestation or disease. So long as a heart tree
stands, its dryad can’t permanently be stopped by death’s
cold embrace.
There are no settlements as mortals reckon them in the
fey homelands, but the dryads whose trees stand inside the
boundaries of a forest consider themselves to be of the
same community. They further divide themselves
into neighborhoods based on the species of their
tree, rather than geographic proximity.
A ternion, formed of the oldest adult, the
youngest adult, and the median members
of the neighborhood oversee all matters
related to their species of dryad. There is
little movement of the oldest member of each
ternion, but the other two members change often enough
to keep the body from becoming stagnant. Each ternion
of a forest meets regularly, once every century or two, to
discuss matters important to the larger dryad community.
Most dryads spend their immortal existences either
alone or with other members of their neighborhood.
Dryad adventurers are considered to be thrill seekers and
daredevils by their communities, and they are urged to go
out into the mortal world to vent their exhilaration, lest
their emotions infect others. These venturers are keen to
move among the shorter-lived races and experience the
pace of their lives and the rapid shifts of their emotions.
DRYAD LINEAGE TRAITS
Your dryad character has the following hereditary traits.
Age. Dryads age slowly in comparison to many
humanoids. They reach adulthood around their hundredth
year and live up to 600 years on the Material Plane. On
their home plane, dryads are immortal as long as their
heart tree stands.
Size. Your size is Medium. Like the trees they are born
from, dryads come in a diverse range of heights and widths.
Dryads stand between 5 and 7 feet tall and rarely weigh
more than 200 pounds.
Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
Darkvision. You have darkvision to a range of 60 feet.
Fey Resilience. You have advantage
on saves against being charmed and
knocked unconscious.
Forest Heart. If your heart tree stands in
your homeland, you can’t die. If killed, your body
decomposes into compost within 10 days, and your spirit
returns to your tree. You emerge from your tree, fully
rested and recovered after 1d20 years. Spells that return
you to life, such as resurrection, can cause you to emerge
before your recovery time elapses. You can’t be returned to
life by the reincarnate spell.
Natural Magic. Your innate connection to the natural
world gives you an affinity with plants and animals.
You know the druidcraft cantrip. In addition, you can
understand and verbally communicate with Beasts and
Plants. This works like the speak with animals spell, except it
also applies to Plants.
Tree Step. You can use 15 feet of your movement to step
into one living tree within your reach and materialize into
an unoccupied space within 5 feet of a second living tree
within 60 feet of the first tree. Both trees must be Large or
larger. You can use this feature a number of times per day
equal to your PB. You regain all expended uses when you
finish a long rest.
