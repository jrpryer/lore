{Mix with ToV Beastkin and Peri monk-likes from the Corpus Angelus}

Young Strix are often driven by curiosity to seek out other civilizations and far-flung environments. Though such wanderlust may last for years, most return to their natural homes in later life, where they often act as surrogate parents in their home territory for raising younger Strix. While all Strix contend with their base urges of curiosity and devotion to knowledge, they are quick to form bonds with those who show them compassion and loyalty, regardless of nationality or creed.

Living in rookeries within every major city across Midgard are the ravenfolk, humanoid creatures with the feathers and features of wingless ravens. Often the subject of suspicion, ravenfolk bear the reputation of solitary wanderers and treacherous thieves, despite their attempts to mimic the cultural identity of wherever they live in an attempt to fit in with the locals.

Legend has it that the origin of the ravenfolk ties back to Wotan the Rune Father, who plucked feathers from his two pet ravens and let them drift down to Midgard, becoming his spies across the world. In truth, the ravenfolk hold the secret knowledge of the branches of Yggdrasil, the world tree, and consider themselves the bridge between everyday life and the realm of the gods.

Ravenfolk culture is built from the surrounding society their rookery is in. Using building materials, mannerisms, languages, and ideals taken from those around them, their homes and culture look like a rough mimicry of the world around them. This reflects their curiosity and their love of taking and keeping the secrets of others.

# Traits
Your Strix character has certain hereditary traits dictated by their lineage:
**Age**. Strix reach adulthood at 10 years old, but live for only a short average lifespan of 50 years.
**Size**. Your size is Medium. Ravenfolk range from 4 feet to just shy of 6 feet tall.
**Speed**. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
**Secretkeeper**. Creatures have disadvantage on Insight checks made to intuit what you are thinking or discern your motives.
**Snatch**. After a creature within 5 feet of you makes a melee attack against you or another creature, you can use your reaction to make a DEX (Sleight of Hand) check to pick the pocket of the attacking creature. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your PB and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
**Natural Adaption**. You inherit one of the following traits determined by the flock characteristics you want your character to be apart of:
- ***Mimicry***. As a *Ravenfolk*, you can mimic any sound you’ve heard. When attempting to fool a creature into thinking the mimicked sound is real, make a CHA (Deception) check opposed by the creature’s WIS (Insight). On a success, you fool the listener into believing that the sound you created is real.
- ***Skyborn***. As an *Eaglekin*, feathered wings sprout from your back or connect to your outstretched arms as you see fit. You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can’t fly while wearing medium or heavy armor. Carrying a heavy load or a creature of your size or larger while flying reduces your speed by half.
