Elvi are a long-lived people, regarded as the first mortal beings to walk alongside the [[Kanirûl Pantheon|Kanirûl]] and most resemble the countenance ― if not the form and presence ― of the [[Echnicans]] themselves. They boast natural ties to Arcane magic and are regarded as the most versatile of the Nashtaran races. Some Elvi scholars believe that their ancestors were Echnican themselves, perhaps sharing a long lost connection to the immortal beings that came to shepherd the newborn land.

Most Elvi are happy to settle anywhere beautiful, though after [[the Departure]] and subsequent wars of [[the Thinning]], the major cities or [[Cara]] and [[Duhn]] are notably siphoned of their original magic and natural beauty.

Due to their long lifespans, many Elvi that survived the wars are First Children of Nashtara and remain uniquely long lived in comparison to their scholarly [[Strix]] siblings. Many older Elvi feel compelled to make nostalgic pilgrimages to Delipol or to [[Ech'Yinara]], the towering, windswept seat of the [[Kanirûl Pantheon|Kanirûl]]. These compulsions also drive Elvi to deepen bonds with other creatures, as they know all too well the fleeting nature of mortal life.

# Traits
Your Elvi character has the following hereditary traits:
**Age**. Although Elvi reach physical maturity around age 20, mental and emotional faculties reach full maturity around the age of 100. No Elvi has yet passed on from natural causes, though Lunatas herself promised the First Children that they were still mortal. %% Elvi can live to be 850 years old. %%
**Size**. Your size is Medium. Elvi range from under 5 feet to over 6 feet tall and tend toward slender builds, averaging around 110 pounds.
**Speed**. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
**Magic Ancestry**. You have advantage on saves against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.
**Trance**. Elvi don’t need to sleep. Instead, they enter a meditative trance state, remaining semiconscious for 4 hours a day. You choose whether or not you can dream while meditating. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that other creatures do from 8 hours of sleep.
**Attuned Prescience**. You gain one of the following traits determined by the inherited characteristics of your character:
- ***Heightened Senses***. As an inheritor of the *Woods*, you have advantage on Perception checks that rely on sight or hearing. 
  Additionally, you have proficiency in Stealth.
- ***Student of Gods***. As a member of the *High* family, once per long rest you can, as an action, cast the lowest circle version of the *comprehend languages* spell without using a spell slot. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is WIS, INT, or CHA (choose which during character creation).
  Additionally, you have proficiency in Persuasion. When you finish a short or long rest, you can exchange this proficiency for Insight, and vice versa.

# Variants
## Ganzi
#REVIEW  
(Syderean, Fey - God-touched, Aasimar) instinctual, pale, #reincarnated
{Although... the Aens'hel are the true Celestial Syderean Aasimars. the Ganzi would likely just be Elvi that have stumbled into a form of reincarnation, or were High Elvi leaders chosen by [[Solanas]] to spite Rhajos and Tevros one last time... }


## Nox'eli
The Nox'eli, known widely as Children of Twilight, are a unique variant of the Elvi lineage blessed by Lunatas and subtly touched by Vespera. These nocturnal beings bear skin of indigo-to-charcoal hues, luminous silver eyes, and flowing white hair—symbols of Echnic blessing. They live quiet, introspective lives, dedicated to cultivation of rare night-blooming plants, philosophical exploration.

#### Origins
In ancient times, the first Nox'eli faithfully tended the sacred night-gardens dedicated to [[Lunatas]], cultivating rare flora that bloomed only under [[Moons#Roida|Roida]]’s crimson gaze and [[Moons#Valya|Valya]]’s gentle luminance. When their devotion attracted Lunatas, she marked them as hers, blessing them with eyes attuned perfectly to moonlight, granting them clarity to fully embrace the serenity of night. [[Darkness|Vespera]], also intrigued by their reverence for subtlety and secrecy, bestowed upon them the gift of silent footsteps and shadow-weaving. Yet, even amidst these profound gifts, the Nox'eli often found themselves gazing skyward, entranced by the shimmering mysteries of the stars, subtly influenced by the mother [[Fate|Asteria]]

#### Society and Culture
Scattered throughout Cara-Duhn, the Nox'eli thrive during twilight and midnight hours, dwelling primarily in small, secluded communities within the grander settlements and cities of the day-walking Cara-Duhnians. Their nocturnal lifestyle complements their contemplative nature, creating a culture that values quiet observation, deep meditation, and subtle interaction with the unseen world. Masters of nocturnal agriculture, the Nox'eli nurture night-blooming flora and fauna renowned for their magical properties, medicinal qualities, and symbolic significance.

Their natural affinity for stargazing and celestial cycles draws them especially toward doctrines influenced by Mother Asteria, further deepening their scholarly and prophetic pursuits. Revered scholars known as the Vox'li, or "Starkeepers", meticulously document celestial movements, interpreting them through complex astrological systems attributed to Asteria’s teachings. When not bent on their studies, Nox of this employment will often take on the role of weavers, crafting textiles shimmering subtly with starlight threads collected from their moonlit gardens.

Another calling that young Nox often are encouraged to pursue at some point in their life is the flowing art of Moonspeaking. These arts were first taught by Lunatas and later began incorporating the natural abilities granted them by Vespera. Harmonizing with the movements of Kanyiirah through their voices and embodying the unique rhythms of the sister moons in their dance across the night sky, these Vix'lo, or "Moonspeakers", elevate their consciousness beyond this current reality. The sacred ritual allows a Nox to momentarily touch the [[Planes of Existence|Ethereal]], weaving illusion magics and subtle enchantments to commune with the Greater Spirits in ways only the high druids have ever achieved.

The Nox'eli embody a philosophy balancing the mystical and tangible worlds, integrating the wise teachings of Lunatas, the subtle secrets of Vespera, and the cosmic insights inspired by Asteria. Their beliefs often draw them to two primary religious factions:
- [[Vólat Church#Current|Vólat-sen]]: Valuing tradition, these adherents harmonize their worship of both pantheons, embracing old rites and venerating ancestral saints, seeing continuity and balance as sacred.
- [[Doctrines#Kindleheart Concordia|Kindleheart Concordia]]: Some Nox'eli gravitate toward this doctrine to pursue freedom in the intricate weavings of the constellations. They are respected as mediators, spiritual guides, and interpreters, offering impartial counsel to explorers and those wrestling with their place in the wider world.

#### Relations with others
The Nox'eli, although self-contained, remain peacefully neutral, willing to guide outsiders or share insights when respectfully approached. Their impartial stance and diplomatic wisdom have earned them reverence as arbiters during disputes among Cara-Duhn’s peoples. They can often be found congregating with [[Strix]], noble [[Alseid]], and older [[Elvi#Ganzi|Ganzi Elvi]].
While misunderstood by some, those who interact with Nox often find them gentle, scholarly, and wise allies rather than elusive or hostile neighbors.

> [!recite|bg-c-blue] _"In shadowed woods beneath starry veils,  We seek not to hide from the sun,  but simply embrace the secrets kept by moon and night.  Where others fear obscurity, we find wisdom;  In darkness, we kindle our greatest light._
~ Poem from Song of the Nox'eli

> [!recite|bg-c-blue] _Under silver eyes we stride, whispers wrapped in velvet cloak,  A boon from mother moons alight, no curse within the night.  We are not hidden in darkness,  But shaped by it—  We are night’s gentle keepers._  
~ Traditional Nox’eli hymn, "Children of Twilight"
