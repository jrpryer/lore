Oread "dwarves" are a hardy people, as sturdy and solid as stone. Most Oread believe they were sculpted from living rock by [[Entropy|Tevros]] long ago and were only later given life by [[Life|Rhajos]] at [[Nashtara]], as all Oread bore adaptations like lowlight vision suited for sunless caverns and resistances to the poisonous toxins and creatures that were discovered below ground.

As the years passed under the nurturing hand of the [[Kanirûl Pantheon|Kanirûl]], Oread spread across the mountainous regions of the sacred isles, some choose to settle under the [[Frostfire Peaks]] of [[Cara]], far from their first steps upon [[Delipol|the Deli]], while others moved inland to [[Duhn]]'s arid mesas and rich iron mines.

The first cities built underground were carved by Oread, filling chiseled mountain halls and sprawling caverns deep within the earth after only a few hundred years. The plentiful ore and minerals [[Pyronia]] led they to provided unique opportunities for their mastery of stoneworking and metalworking, giving these first Oread the tools to thrive long after [[the Departure]].
