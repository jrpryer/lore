At [[Nashtara]], it became clear that the deep magic that had summoned the races was careful to select a balance of traits in each people. Some were more cultured and beared hidden skills of writing, song, and elevated language. Others were more suited to survive the harshness of a new and unexplored land.

Nagaji range in appearance, but they are all scaled bipeds who stand slightly taller than a human on average. Some Nagaji develop frills on their heads, spines, and spindly limbs, but just as many do not. The coloration of a Nagaji’s scales ranges from dull ochres through to vibrant greens, though blue, black, and gray scaled examples can be found as well.

Nagaji are hearty and capable of existing just about anywhere in the world. They live primarily in small scattered settlements away from the cities and territories of other peoples, but still maintain basic decorum hammered into them by [[Taerannon]]. While each settlement has its own identity, they share characteristics in that they are mostly focused around hunting and gathering. Nagaji also tend to be youth-centric, with older members of the community teaching the youngest members the basics of survival while the mature adults take care of the community’s needs. 

# Traits 
Your Nagaji character has the following hereditary traits.
**Age**. Nagaji mature rapidly and reach adulthood by age 16. They rarely live longer than 60 years.
**Size**. Your size is Medium. Male and female Nagaji stand 6 feet tall on average, with the females being notably slimmer than the males.
**Speed**. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. You have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.
**Armored Scales**. When you aren’t wearing armor, you have a natural AC of 13 + your DEX modifier. 
**Bite**. You can make unarmed strikes with your sharp teeth. When you hit with your bite, the bite deals piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your STR or DEX modifier (choose which during character creation), instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.
**Hold Breath**. You can hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to your CON score (minimum 10 minutes).
