(ah-KWAH-lee / ˈɑː.kwɑː.liː)
**Lineage Language**: Aqualii uniquely speak a lineal language called [[Aquan|Qualissë]], simply called "[[Aquan]]" in the common Trade languages.

One of the largest people groups in terms of population, the Aqualii call the sea itself home. They are perhaps the most adaptable species that reside on the Kanyiiran sphere. They are the only group that arrived during [[Nashtara]] to venture beyond the [[Eternal Maelstrom|Mists of Dolos]].  

They are a reclusive people, their heritage and cultural groups close-knit, often bearing outright hostility to other Aqualii nations and even dissuading intermarriage between different Tide castes of their own dominions. They are seen by the nations of Cara-Duhn as strict, traditional, and dangerous. Their religious beliefs are tied to the [[Moons]] of Kanyiirah, holding to only the barest Vólatian interpretations of the Passions and Apathies, the dangers of [[Umbravex]]'s [[Leviathans|spawn]], and maintaining the true history of the Moons. They are divided into three main people groups:

- Aazhalis - aggressive, militaristic, ocean-born
- Shae’thalis - flowing, artistic, reef-born
- Tuik'qualis - traditional, secluded, artic-born

# Aqualii Landmarks
- The Ceaspira caverns - A great collection of open air caves that follow a winding trench south of Delipol. The great Shae’thalish city of Azentrim marks the southernmost undersea entrance to the caverns.

- Shaal’thaarn (shawl-THARN) – “The Whispering Reef,” a sprawling coral forest imbued with spiritual significance.  
- Thaenalas (thae-NAH-las) – “The Abyss Gate,” a dark trench believed to connect to an ancient, mythical city far beneath the oceans.  
- Veraaquae (vee-ray-KWAY) – “The Frozen Flow,” an icy river of undersea glacial meltwaters. 
- Naa’qualim (nah-KWAH-limb) – “The Sacred Basin,” a ceremonial gathering place for Aqualii rites.  

# Cultural Heritage
## Aazhalis 
"People of the Waves" 
- The most hostile and warlike of the Aqualii, the Aazhalis are the foremost defenders against the spawn of [[Umbravex]]. They are of the oldest bloodlines, progenitors of the other major Aqualii people groups.
- The Aazhalish dialect is a balance of poetic elegance and practicality for long-distance communication. Smooth consonants and fewer tonal shifts.

## Shae’thalis 
"People of the Reefs" 
- Those who dwell in coral structures and shallower regions. These people are the group most associated with the Aqualii at large, being the group most often encountered by trade ships and pirates. These also see the [[Eternal Maelstrom]] as a protective gift, choosing to remain within the safety provided by the Mists and keep the corruption of [[Evryn]] contained, rather than face the mightier [[Leviathans|spawns of Umbravex]] that lay beyond.
- The Shae’thalish speech is more clipped and colloquial than Aazhalis, reflecting the reef-dwellers’ faster-paced lives.

## Tuik'qualis 
"People of the Freeze" 
- Evolved among the cold, abyssal trenches of the polar regions, these people are the most reclusive and traditional of the Aqualii.
- The Tuik'qualish dialect features harsher consonants and shorter vowels, mimicking the abrupt sounds of cracking ice and deep-sea echoes.
