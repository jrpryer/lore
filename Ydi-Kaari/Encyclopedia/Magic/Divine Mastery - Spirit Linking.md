# Spirit Linking
>[!recite|bg-c-gray]  *All magic demands sacrifice; mastery is yielding the self to the trust of empowered bonds, for the strength of many outmatch the power of one.*

Spirit Linking is the ultimate power of Divine law, allowing for the creation of bonds between a Soul and the lesser or Greater spirits. At this level of mastery, links can even be anchored to inanimate objects, creating a permanent form of sentience as it ties the soul to the object. However, the most common use of this power is to conjure a corporeal anchor that is fashioned after the nature of the spirit; a manifestation of the soul's identity.

Recently, other uses of this mastery has come to light: true masters seem to gain the ability to elevate their lesser spirits to Greater ones, allowing for the preparation of one's soul for the death of the body as a means of embracing the form of a Greater spirit and the true survivability of a mortal in the Ethereal plane. 
Additionally, while the binding of multiple Spirits to a singular Soul is common amongst aged and powerful identities, certain practices amongst the monk-like [[Vaal'k|Vaal'korr]] sons of [[Aethmi-Istar]] have led to the discovery of soft linkings being achieved between a singular Spirit and multiple Souls, allowing for the sharing of communal senses and experiences between the participating Forms for a short period of time.

# Mystery
>The nature of [[Aethmi-Istar|Holy Aesuhir]]'s ascension by the Mother [[Fate|Asteria]] was a closely guarded secret, known only by the Archbishop of the [[Vólatian Theocracy#Centenary|Vólatian Centenary]], and passed from bishop to bishop over the centuries. This process allows for the unlocking of a being’s Greater Spiritual form, at least for those with a Divine anchor. This gives the individual control over their own form, before gaining true Divine mastery over the Linking of other spirits.
