# True Naming
>[!recite|bg-c-gray] *All magic demands sacrifice; mastery is the art of surrendering certainty and control to be remade into true purity.*

3.5 Tomes of Magic - https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/classes/baseTom/truenamer.html 

The power of Names is a rare and mysterious Primordial power, on scale with the Divine power of Spirit Linking, the Wyrd power over Blood, and the Arcane Words of Power. Slightly connected to the Arcane Words of Power, True Names are simply the truth of all living things. They transcend simple language and are directly tied to souls.

%% Primordial Law also dictates the means by which the power of The Endless is transferred; by Naming their successor, the bearer Spirit of a mote of Infinity may transfer the mantle of their cosmic principle to another Spirit.

Without a proper Named successor, the power of Infinity weathers on the Soul to the nth degree, like a violent storm held within a fragile vessel: to grasp even a shred of Infinity through forced or coerced means is to invite the most brutal and vengeful curse. %%

%% This is how the power of Myst came to reside within [[Lunatas]]. Myst knew her pupil was not yet ready to bear the responsibility as one of the Endless, and chose to fragment the mote of Infinity as well, which allowed the power to be spread to the other members of the [[Kanirûl Pantheon|Kanirûl]] without bearing the Naming curse. %% 


# Mystery
> Walking the path of Primordial secrets gives one access to hear and understand the Names of things, granting them autonomy of their own Name and subtle influence over the Names of items they attune or people they are close with. This allows them to be acutely aware of any resonances that are influencing people or things they have heightened their attention towards.
