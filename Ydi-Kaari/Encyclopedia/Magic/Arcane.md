Arcane power is the secret thread that ties the universe together. The ebb and flow of this font is directly tied to the discernment one can bring to decipher the simple laws of nature. Mathematics, physics, trigonometry, etc. all fall under a form of calculated arcane mastery. 

Arcane casters draw power from measurable forces that govern material reality. This includes forces like heat, space, and gravity. An Arcane caster can use a precise combination of words, gestures, and materials to ignite a roaring flame or link two distant locations. 

Arcane magic is governed by an extensive set of rules and calculations, which a caster uses to enact effects. Due to its complexity, Arcane spellcasting often resembles a fusion of philosophy and mystical workings. Harnessing magic from this source requires creativity, precision, and a drive for perfection. It should be noted that due to this colder, more logical approach, many mages and researchers have discovered Arcane source to be anathema to the [[Passions & Apathies]]. They seem to abhor its presence and cannot exist in close proximity to a font of Arcane. 

The tools of Arcane magic are varied and often highly personal to the caster. Common tools used to focus the intention and purpose of a caster include runes, recitations, and hand gestures. 

A spell might be Arcane if it: 
- Detects, suppresses, ends, or otherwise interacts with mechanical aspects of spellcasting. 
- Harnesses calculated elemental energy (acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder). 
- Interacts with a creature’s senses, whether to fool them or to extend their capabilities in a specific way.
