# Blood
> [!recite|bg-c-blue] "We are all of The Blood. Made men, by The Blood. Undone, by The Blood. Our eyes are yet to open... FEAR the Old Blood."  
> ~ Osmandius IV, King of Dirnathus

>[!recite|bg-c-gray] *All magic demands sacrifice; mastery is the embrace of the unknown, offering all — be it flesh, bone, or blood — to direct the unseen river.*

The law of blood is a universal truth of all creatures. Mastery of [[Wyrd]] source provides the user with acute control of the chemical makeup of blood and the permanent??? control of any chosen alterations made to its composition. #REVIEW

# Mystery
> Wyrd Mysteries are the most chaotic, requiring the sculpting of flesh to reveal secrets of the Third Sight. Sometimes seen as a shortcut to true mastery of Blood and the prestige of cultivated heritages, the Third Sight gives one momentary control of another creature's senses, allowing one to see through the target's eyes, know their thoughts, hear and smell their surroundings. If enough will is burned, they may also walk, speak, and act through their puppet for a short time.
