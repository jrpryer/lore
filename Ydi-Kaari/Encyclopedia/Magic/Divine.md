Heavily tied to the [[Kanirûl Pantheon|Kanirûl]], divine magic is born of belief and devout adherence to a cause or domain of a deity. The Kanirûl themselves were conduits of their homeland, radiating powerful magics of healing, illumination, and revelation. By venerating them, Cara-Duhnian casters are able to tap into the fold of their chosen entity and multiply the power within, expanding that capacity rather than reducing or diminishing it. This is the magic of bonds, oaths, prayers, and blessings. It should be noted that true divination of fate and visions into future events is a rare form of Divine power on Kanyiirah.

Divine casters draw power from the connectivity between beings. A Divine caster can imbue a dying creature with the will to live, channel a god’s wrath into a fierce storm, or restore withered crops to a starving community. 

Divine magic is unique in the way it requires a connection between the caster and at least one other being to function; it is communal in essence. Harnessing magic from this source requires devotion, awareness of others, and/or belief in improving the world for those served (even if that 'improvement' is fully subjective and the outcome ends up hurting others, as long as the belief is there, the source magic will respond).

The common model for Divine magic frames it within religious faith, where an individual enacts the will of a god. However, the Divine source is also accessible to a caster who acts out of devotion to a particular community, an evil pact set forth by a cult, or any similarly compelling external creed. Because of this, to the untrained eye, Divine magic can sometimes be mistaken for Wyrd magic depending on the perception of the caster; wherever need exists, there is the potential for Divine magic.

A spell might be Divine if it: 
- Specifically interacts with another creature’s life force, whether to heal or harm.
- Harnesses radiant or necrotic energy.
- Specifies interaction with a deity or includes the word “faith” in the description.
