Deeply tied to the [[Anarûl Pantheon|Anarûl]], Primordial magic connects one to the substance of reality, calling upon the vast fonts of power that sleep within all things. 

Primordial casters draw power from the primal energies of nature. A Primordial caster can cause a forest to sprout from barren land, spur the rapid decay of flesh, or instantly restructure their biology to change forms. 

Harnessing magic from this source requires awareness of the environment, knowledge of the building blocks of life, and respect for the power inherent in nature. 

Primordial magic is defined by how a caster interacts with energy that is actively present in the surroundings, whether amplifying, suppressing, altering, redirecting, or encouraging it. A Primordial caster understands that a finite amount of energy exists in nature, and this magic tips the scales of balance in just the right ways to enact a caster’s will. Primordial magic always draws from nature itself and can’t be accessed without placing its interests first.

A spell might be Primordial if it:
- Alters or enhances a creature’s biological characteristics.
- Specifically interacts with plants or animals.
- Replicates an effect that could possibly occur as a natural phenomenon (i.e. pure elemental phenomena)
