Within the infinite cosmos that holds the Ydi-Kaari system, there exists an additional strong force of Aether, suffusing every building block of the universe, binding, stretching, and contractrating the [[Planes of Existence]]. This force is responsible for connecting [[Souls, Spirits, Forms|Souls to Spirits, and Spirits to forms]] and is the conduit by which magic threads its way into the Mundane realm as well, making the words Aether, magiks, and magic synonymous in this world.

The raw, coursing power of Aether – or magic – is then balanced between four sources of magic; that of [[Primordial]], [[Divine]], [[Arcane]], and [[Wyrd]]. 
Source magic synergies occur regularly within nature; depending on the sources involved, these weavings result in effects of varying stability.
There are three known methods of combining the core sources, referred to as the First, Second, and Third Laws of True Magic:

- **First Law**: The most stable forces in the universe are combinations of **opposing sources** and consequently, are the most difficult outcomes to achieve. (i.e. Divine * Wyrd)
- **Second Law:** Another possibility is the combination of **neighboring sources**, and though it results in slightly less powerful and stable outcomes than the first, it is easier to achieve. (i.e. Arcane * Wyrd)
- **Third Law**: By far the easiest and most common combinations in the universe are the multiplicative bonds of **like sources**. Though these are the weakest and most diluted magical forces, they are also the most numerous, deepening the font of the source to the -nth degree. (i.e. Primordial * Primordial)

# Convergence
 When at least two forms of source magic are combined in a ritual of fusion called a **Convergence**, they must obey one of these laws. When either the First or Second laws are observed, the catalyzed outcome is anchored along one parent and 'reflected' along the mirror path of transformation from the remaining catalyst parent to fall under the corresponding new source.
 %% Convergences can occur due to the existence and interactions of two cosmic principles: [[Family of the Endless#Fracture|Flux]] and [[Family of the Endless#Inversion|Reflection]]. %%

## Convergence examples 
For instance, the creation of the [[Kanirûl Pantheon|Kanirûl]] was the result of a First Law Convergence between some [[Family of the Endless|great Primordial power]] and the opposite Arcane power of the World Tree in Greater Echnica. The outcome reflected perfectly and rooted the seven Echnicans of the Kanirûl pantheon stably under the Divine source of magic.

Similarly, by a Second Law Convergence, the union of the Divine [[Valencia]] and the Primordially-favored [[Aethmi-Istar|Aesuhir]] was first anchored in the Divine power of the walking goddess, landing their first few children between the sources of Divine and Arcane magics. After [[Aethmi-Istar]] ascended to [[Lämmrus|Lusturil]], their second union was then anchored in the Primordial power of the Mother [[Fate|Asteria]], landing their remaining children — the [[Vaal'k|Vaal'korr]] and [[Vaal'k|Vaal'kuhrea]] demigods — between the sources of Primordial and Wyrd magic.
