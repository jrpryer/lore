# Words of Power
>[!recite|bg-c-gray] *All magic demands sacrifice; mastery is the pursuit of shaping chaos into clarity, perfecting form into sharp, reliable action.*

Words of Power are the ultimate form of mortal magic. By breaking down the fundamental rules of the harmonious formulas of the cosmos, a master arcanist can arrange commands to instruct the fabric of reality to bend to their will. These Words of Power are the basis of spells in every circle, though only those masters capable of seeing past the restrictions of simple language can hope to craft them into true new spells of their own design.

The Arcane specialty in Words of Power has the most complete grasp of the [[Laws of True Magic]]. Words of Power are the only known force capable of controlling the catalyst ‘anchor’ during a convergence of two source magics, allowing for the controlled combination of just about every possible form of magic and reducing the risk of undesirable reflections along the axis of the sources.

# Mystery
>Beings of an Arcane anchor are capable of discovering their hidden Sigil; a mark of overlapping arcane equations that resonate with their soul in a unique way, unlocking access to more power for them and granting them access to greater, unique Words of Power.
