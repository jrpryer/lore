> "Divine Substance"

Black in its oxidized, untreated state but marble-like when worked and sealed to preserve its barely-iridescent white shine. Veins of gold, sapphire, and silver can be found in its strata. As its structure is normally brittle like obsidian, it can be difficult to extract in large, homogeneous quantities, though it can be infused with Primordial source magic to soften it and turn it malleable like a soft metal or stiff clay.

Only ever found in one mine, deep beneath [[Petyrgrad]] in the [[Frostfire Peaks]].
