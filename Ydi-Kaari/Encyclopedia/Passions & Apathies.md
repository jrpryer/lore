> [!recite|bg-c-blue] _Though we are exposed to them at birth, it is known that both the Passions and Apathies are effectors of the mind. Thus, it was the hope of our Vólat faculty founders that we practice working through our problems logically, training to control our natural impulsions to keep these spirits at bay._

# The Passions
 The offspring of the Father [[Life|Rhajos]], The Herald of Delights. They are augmenters, embodiments of what it means to be alive on the sphere of Kanyiirah. They are ephemeral, powerful things that feed on the emotions of the heart and have the boon of coming upon mortals like a possessing spirit, heightening and sharpening the senses. They are: **Ecstasy**, **Fervor**, **Pride**, **Inspiration**, and **Ambition**.

# The Apathies
To understand the Apathies though, we must first speak of [[Aethmi-Istar|Holy Aesuhir]], Lord-Eternal: the mortal-made-god who sought to emulate the Kanirûl. Writings of the [[Aethmi-Istar|Holy Aesuhir]] — as they are captured in the early editions of the Book of Thorns — speak of this Vólat cardinal's pilgrimage through the upright and moral living of an unscrupulous life, telling of how he found favor with the Mother [[Fate|Asteria]] and was granted entrance into Lusturil’s golden halls as a newly Ascended deity.

The scriptures tell of how [[Aethmi-Istar|Holy Aesuhir]]'s journey caught the attention of the goddess of love, of how the years before his ascension to Lusturil, Holy Aesuhir lustfully lay with The Heartkindler [[Valencia]], causing an unforeseen tragedy to befall them: due to her divine nature and the [[Laws of True Magic|Second Law of True Magic]], the children born of their relationship were cursed without forms, existing as baleful spirits. These young souls were intangible amalgamations, named in order of birth, the Apathy **Iniquity**, then **Indifference**, **Greed**, **Strife**, and finally **Hate**.
  
After their father's ascension to [[Aethmi-Istar]] and his departure to the heavenly realm of [[Lämmrus|Lusturil]], The Apathies became too wild and unruly for the good-hearted Valencia to manage. She sought help from the rest of the Kanirûl and Luntas brought the offspring before the Father Rhajos to be tamed, so that their natures would not destructively influence the mortal races that newly walked upon Kanyiirah. And so The Herald of Delights became the adoptive father of the Apathies as well, balancing the existence of the Passions with the contrast of yearning Apathies. 

They too feed on the respective emotions of mortals and immortals alike, influencing the mind and spirit wherever possible, but remaining eschewed by Arcane source magic, as it weakens all of them.

## Lost Son
But alas, Hate was not the youngest of Valencia's Kanyiiran children. Just after Aethmi-Istar left her to take his place among the heavenly halls, The Heartkindler found herself again with child. She was confused, as the memory of her final feast-filled night with the newly-ascended deity was clouded with her secret drunken desires for the touch of another... the great Judge of Souls, [[Entropy|Tevros]]. It is said that she went missing from the party for several hours before returning to the father of her first children and retiring together with him. It wasn't until the birth of this final child that the power grown within her was so clearly originated from the Father of War; the infant was immense in size and stature, bearing the true body of the Primordial heritage that flowed in its veins. Bringing the child into the physical world would surely have marked the death of Valencia had she not been an immortal.

Once her torturous labor had abated, she became anxious that others would seek to exploit the child's heritage and nurture it into a weapon of war. So she sought out a way to hide the child called Destruction. Seeing her plight, the Mother [[Darkness|Vespera]] descended to her side and offered her an exchange... The new Apathy would be sequestered away into a demiplane of her own creation, a place where it would be safe from any that would seek to do it harm. In return, Valencia would construct a great temple to Vespera in Delipol, looking west towards Dön and the setting Suhns. There, Vespera would allow The Heartkindler to visit her child in secret, whenever she wished.  
  
This exchange worked well for a time. Destruction grew into a powerful yet gentle giant, a lover of architecture and student of the great artistic marvels the mortal races shared under the peaceful reign of their gods. Through Vespera's guidance, Destruction linked its spirit to places all across Cara-Dön, watching with eager eyes as the young world unfolded. Often the youngest of the Apathies would speak of its interests to its mother, for it was only when The Heartkindler would come visit it, that the Apathy could manifest its great form; one whose footsteps would shake the great boulders of the Deli when it heard its mother's voice. Valencia found such peace in those days, stealing away from the rigors of rule to be with a soul that truly, unconditionally loved her so dearly. It was her wish that her child could build her a new home, away from the pains and powers of this world, where one day she could finally rest in safety. She watched with gentle pride as it tried to do just that, quarrying the raw black slate from the cliffs of Delipol to construct her a place of shelter.  
  
But that day the goddess dreamed of was never to come to pass. Instead came the day of Valencia's untimely death. The day the Mother [[Darkness|Vespera]] chose not to honor her pact with the Kanirûl goddess of beauty. Destruction watched in helpless horror as the depraved Thief Rathus and his ilk fell upon its mother's crumpled form. The spirit of all the Passions and Apathies raged that night upon the Deli, whipped into a frenzy as their raw natures drove their mother's assassins forward, spilling her divine blood on the steps of the very shrine she had erected to the Mother of Trickery. Destruction could do nothing, submerged in a sea of turmoil, not knowing how to hold the weight of true mutilation and depravity unfolding before its eyes. It wasn't until the newly cursed creatures had finally fled the scene of their crime that the Apathy stirred. No peace would comfort the traumatized colossi. Numb, broken, and manic, the greatest of the Apathies fell about doing the only thing that seemed to matter anymore: it built inside its prison. Stone by agonizing stone, Destruction carved a feat of mastery, manifesting its hulking form through sheer force of will to finish collecting the materials from the land, channeling the pain, the loss, the horror; Destruction fed upon these to build a massive city. A final resting place for his murdered mother, so that it might finally fulfill her wish and lay her to rest.  
  
The city of Delz Ilgar is itself the incarnation of the lost Apathy Destruction. When great slaughters take place, and the deaths of thousands are counted, many claim to see the city take form above them, distant chimes of sepulchral bells ringing clear the tides of destruction mortal hands have dealt and ushering the souls of the dammed to the Gates of Silence in the Underworld.
