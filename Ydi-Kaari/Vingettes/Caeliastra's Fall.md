The legend of Rukhzar Mao and the final confrontation with the Divine Titan, Caelaistra:

I screamed aloud as the magic took me, the pain of teleportation stinging like a thousand angry hornets and washing over me worse than ever before. And possibly for the last time ever.

_She has fled far this time._

Frigid winter air greeted me and the bite of a north wind replaced the stinging magic as the arcane aura ebbed, then receded completely. The white gleam of snow and ice reflected the Suhn’s rays into my eyes painfully as the tracking crystal shattered in my hand. I stumbled, letting my body adjust to the shock of temperature change and... elevation? Yes, I found it difficult to draw in air as my lungs burned for larger gulps than before.

_She’s run to the Frostfire Peaks, then. This is an appropriate place for her to die._

I plowed my way through ankle-deep snow to a nearby rock outcropping and leaned against its ice-slicked surface. I slowed my breathing a bit, and swept my eyes across the barren landscape, squinting against the brightness of the midday Suhn, and finally spotted the hulking form of my prey. There, with wings outstretched and talons clenching the peak of the nearest mountain was the titanic form of the Divine Phoenix Caelaistra. Her feathers gleamed with a wispy radiance that seemed to ripple across her form like a soft fire. The pearlescence of her beak and avian legs tucked from sight as she shuddered against the mountainside, only one talon visible to me as it latched onto one of the shorter peaks, steadying the slight swaying of her upper half.

_So, Ki’ju did manage to land quite the blow. I grinned to myself, my heart racing in anticipation. This may not be as difficult as we all believed. Who would have thought such a being could actually fall to less magic so quickly._

**_“I have not fallen yet, mortal child.”_**

The voice seemed to boom around me, nearly knocking me off my feet in surprise as my lungs involuntarily gulped in more air. I spun, looking for the source of the voice, but saw no one. 

**_“You chase after me like a lamb; nay you are more a poisonous leach, come to kill me and drain my body of its purpose, its POWER. You mortals are all the same: coveting everything you don’t have, even if it KILLS you to grasp at it.”_**

My head throbbed with the reverberations and I spun back to look upon the form of the injured Titan, realizing it was speaking directly to my very mind. So... was it she that had gifted the Idanthi their mythical gift of telepathy? Or did they perhaps learn it from her and her kind? The similarity was uncanny but her voice; it carried a commanding fury that caused such a panic to rise within me that I nearly turned tail and fled down the deadly slopes to my doom.

I shook myself and set my jaw. _No, she is weakened and lashing out. I must have her worried and so she reacts like a cornered kitten._ 

**_“I am the celestial fabric of the SKY ITSELF, worm. Kittens barely know to extend their claws; test me mortal, and I will pluck you from the grasp of gravity itself and flung you beyond the reach of Asteria.”_**

“You boast with the presence of your younger self, abomination,” I called out into the winds. Perhaps unnecessary, but my voice felt stronger from my own throat than within my head. “Your kind has roamed this land for too long, you endanger the people that now call it home. Face me and meet your true end with honor. I will send you to join your brother Ferrovus in the halls of your—”

**_“SHUT YOUR GODSFORSAKEN LOWLAND MOUTH, YOU POLISHED EXCUSE OF A FIEND’S TURD!”_**

With a violent *_crunch_* the mountain peak that she clutched between her talons shattered, the rocky crag exploding into a cloud of dust and sending a landslide of broken boulders and ice tumbling down into the canyons below. I fell backward, landing rather ungracefully in a sprawling heap upon the icy slick stone beneath me. Dazed, I tried to stand and realized for the first time that a small, hollowed-out cave lay just behind me in the mountainside. And there — glowing with a faint, wispy radiance about her and shoulders heaving with passionate rage — stood a slender Idanthi woman with stark white hair and piercing crystal blue eyes.

My initial shock of teleportation was nothing compared to this sight. The woman wore a simple white dress that hung loosely from her pale shoulders. Her nails looked to be well-groomed and painted with a soft pearlescence that flickered as she clenched her fists. The teeth she bared in a wild snarl were perfectly white and the softness of her complexion was only shadowed by the icy glare she fixed me with.

I slowly picked myself up off the ground, holding out my hand to deter her from leaping upon me and tearing out my eyes, as she seemed poised to do.

“I— you aren’t...” My eyes flicked between the heaving form of the titanic Phoenix only some 300 meters away and the short woman before me. “How? You are Idanthi?”

**_“I am whatever I choose to be, worm. And I choose to watch my prey up close, before tearing its flesh from its bones.”_**

The lips of the woman moved, but the voice was still the echoing reverberation within my skull. Wary, I stood and stepped back to my rock that jutted just within the mouth of the cave, hand on my drawn Runeblade but resting the tip against the snow-covered ground.

“You may try, ancient one. But my mission remains the same. I have been tasked with removing you from the shores of Cara before you slice another mountain city with your razor-sharp talons, or send another hurricane to swallow the southern Isles.”

The snarl faded and Idanthi-form of Caeliastra slowly straightened her shoulders, meeting my steady gaze with a grim look of her own. 

**_“You speak of my landing upon the fjord last winter. And the eastern winds that threatened the coast of Cara that the Maelstrom spat out this last month.”_** 

I felt my eyes growing wide as the Titan spoke. I admit, my heart fluttered at the realization of what was taking place. There was no record of any Titan speaking with one of the younger races. It is true that the Idanthi often painted great art of them and seemed to honor and worship them as individuals, but having a conversation with one? While I sought to shed its lifeblood, no less? This was a novelty amongst novelties.

She was also quite beautiful, once her temperament cooled from the short, rageful outburst. Although she still held herself as a queen and looked down on me with a disdain one might use to examine sick cattle.

**_“These were not incidents of neglect, child. I was protecting these isles from threats your people did not perceive. That is MY mission, given me by the Mother Asteria herself.”_**  She shook her head slowly. **_“Truly, do your people always place their strongest upon paths of death and glory, armed with only zeal as you set off like a newborn babe learning to walk? You are ignorant to the movings of this Sphere and know nothing of the consequences your mission’s fulfillment would bring.”_**

I decided to try another approach. 

“Then tell me, Divine Phoenix; educate me on how the deaths of our innocents holds your world together while decimating my own?” My tone was biting, but I sheathed my Runeblade, hoping it would throw her off. Her eyes narrowed as I relaxed against the stone slightly, her posture tense but no longer hostile.

**_“There is nothing for me to gain in giving you a history lesson. Contrary to what you might think, you pose no threat to me Bladesman. You wield Ek’loma, the Night Reaver. That is not of my ial’ot – my source.”_** 

Her eyes gleamed with a smug attitude and her posture fully relaxed into a haughty air of disinterest. **_“Your blade can only pierce the hide of Umbravex who, sadly, has decided he’d rather lurk in his precious caverns near Ceaspira than govern the seas as he was commanded.”_**

And there it was. My quarry slumbered in the Ceaspira caverns. 

“You speak of Umbravex but become a thundercloud at the mention of Ferrovus? Tell me, do you play favorites amongst all your kin?”

The glowering returned, along with a twinge of disgust around the words.

_**“The others are NOT my kin, mortal whelp. I am of the planes above you all; my fire burns with Lusturil’s very own light, a sight no mortal is meant to ever lay eyes upon. Ferrovus was a quick-burning flame that destroyed all he touched, as he was told. It was not until the very end of his time that he came unto himself and sought to do right by Sylvania.”**_ 

Her eyes began to drift and unfocus, seeming to recall the imagery from so many hundreds of years ago. I leaned into this, slowly pushing off the rock and taking a hesitant step forward.

“What were your roles, after the isles were carved as the Mothers and Fathers desired? Why keep you bound to these forms any longer than absolutely necessary?”

Surprisingly, Caeliastra just sighed. It was a ragged, tired sigh, heavy with frustration, disgust, and longing. 

**_“We were bound to the Sphere itself; its laws and nature are part of us, now and forever._**

**_“Sylvania was the first to reach the end of her time of walking. She asked Ferrovus to carry her to the one land she had not yet touched, and the forests of Duhn have been her resting place. She watches over them silently now, speaking with the flora and fauna that partook of the gifts her walking form brought._**

**_“Ferrovus followed after. Descending into one of Umbravex’s inland tunnels, he disappeared underground to finish out his time of walking beneath the land he had carved. It is my belief that he was ashamed of how imperfect it was in his eyes. I saw his fire rise within the bellies of the twin fire mountains not seven winters ago, which I inferred to mean his time had come._**

**_“Umbravex... always kept to itself. That was an odd one, choosing the company of the Idanthi over us most decades. It lent them its power over the waters, but soon after your people arrived, Umbravex found the presence of your gods to be sickening and has chosen to remain beneath the waves.”_**

“So none of the others kept to their promise, at least not as long as you have,” I offered. She shot me an annoyed look, but I continued, “You have soared the skies, touched the Sphere wherever you have wished, and watched our world unfold and blossom. The changing of unnumerable seasons. New life, new beginnings, death... Are you not tired of it all? When will your time of walking come to an end?

“This world no longer belongs to you, oh ancient one. Your wings carry you upon skies that no longer require your guardianship. Come, lay yourself at our feet, and meet your end with honor and grace.”

_**“You. Know. NOTHING of my mandate, mortal. I am the fire of the morning blaze that sweeps from the Deli to the Dolosian Mists. The Aurelyn themselves call me matron. I herald your very harvests, for Rhajos’s sake!”**_

Her body quaked with a fit of anger and she slammed a balled fist into the cave wall beside her, cracking the hard granite with a permanence that shook me. She was truly there in front of me somehow. Her spiritual will strong enough to maintain two physical forms without breaking. It was remarkable to behold.

_**“My death is only Tevros' to grant. You, little mortal mouse, have nothing to offer me but words that would poison my mind, and bones that may try to choke me while I consume you.”**_

That was the prompt for my exit. As her smaller figure dove for my throat, the shadow of her winged form blotted out the Suhns above me. Ki’ju and I had to be swift.

I dropped to one knee and spun to avoid her bony, talon-like fingers, giving my cohort enough space to spring from his place of hiding and strike. He had only one opening, a chance to strike down her humanoid form slaying her defenseless spirit and bringing low the mighty Phoenix for good.

Like me, Ki’ju wielded one of the holy Runeblades. Unlike me, he wielded Sol'ena, Light's Grace: the only blade capable of wounding the Divine Titan.

His powerful horizontal slice struck true, following the flow of my spin perfectly to catch the Titan off-guard. There was the crunch of my armor on stone, the hum of Ki’ju’s blade cutting through air, then skin, then bone... A wail of suffering erupted from her severed throat, then was instantly drowned out by the thunderous roar that slammed into us from above half a beat later. The form of the Phoenix let out its bloodcurdling screech in pain and tumbled limply from the air where, not moments before, it had hovered to strike me down.

My spin carried me into a tumbling roll as I dove to avoid the falling rubble that the hulking feathered form brought down as it smashed into the mountainside. The very earth itself heaved, tossing my body like a wet paper doll against the jagged walls of the shallow cave. My vision went dark, just as Ki’ju bellowed my name and grabbed my arm, pulling me into the safety of the thicker walls deeper in the cave.
