The light of the full crimson moon streamed through the tattered curtains of their makeshift interrogation room. I sat as before in the too-soft chair, though now my shirt collar was undone and sweat poured down my brow. A silver-white light was fading from the irises of the woman crouched in front of me as the pressure from her slender fingers were removed from my temples.
I still couldn't breathe.
Gasping, I yanked myself back and tried to catch my breath, my chest heaving as I gulped the live-giving air
"Calm yourself, child. It was only a dream. Your body believes it was drowning not a moment ago." Her velvet voice cut through the fog of my mind as my senses returned in a rush. The man who had first ushered me in now stood from where he had leaned on the desk apprehensively. "Well?"

"He arrived on the *Nilraata*. Though he truly has no memory of what happened to your man, I believe you will find all the evidence you need in the hull of that ship."

The woman stood, wiping my sweat from her hands on a neatly folded handkerchief untucked from her blouse. Turning back to the man in the suit, she eyed him carefully while deftly tying her hair back up into it's original intricate bun. 

"Whatever power that has affected him is fearful... it flinched away from my touch with a violent nature like an animal caught in a trap. Once it realized I was after the boy and not it, the vision of drowning came to him and began to suffocate him."

The water. The Shadow that prowled above me in my nightmares. Yes, it moved like a thing in water, blotting out the light with it's mere presence in my subconscious.
It was there now.
I swallowed the saliva and phantom taste of sea water back down and cleared my eyes to watch my abductors more closely.

Just then, the door of the cramped office swung open and rotund older gentleman barged his way in. He began shouting at the man in the suit, berating him for his brash action of snatching me off the street. 
"In broad daylights, man! There were Consortium members in the crowd that gathered and you didn't even bother to hide your company badge!" The man's face was growing red almost immediately. No doubt a superior of some kind. Glancing my way, he nearly jumped out of his skin at the sight of the woman. Surprise, disgust, and then fear all passed across his face at once before he stepped around the man in the suit and put distance between himself and the woman.

"Yâ€“you brought a grey witch with you as well? Lost Gods man, you've gone mad."
At this, the face of my original abductor grew hard.
"Escaldia Miar is a respectable noble visiting us from Cara, Viktor, and was gracious enough to answer my urgent request at this late hour. We have nothing to fear from her talents here; she is not nearly as unhinged as her Red cousins."

At the mention of the Crimson Witch coven, those silver eyes once again flared, if but for the briefest moment, replaced by a charming and placid smile that almost seemed to brighten the dingy room.
Or perhaps her latent magiks still swam in my head.
"I do apologize if my presence frightens you constable. I'll ensure to not sully your investigation any further."
As she made for the door and the suited man followed, she cast another look back at me and spoke under her breath words that shook me to my core: 
"It was not me his shadow hid from, Lucalis... That darkness fears discovery by a power much, much greater."
