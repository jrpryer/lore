(mew-RAY)

%% A bleak, craggy sphere, crisscrossed with massive ravines that cut into the surface like open wounds. A thin, ethereal mist hangs over the surface of the entire planetoid, moving as if alive, curling into the cracks and thinly veiling the view of Hræth and the cold sky from those who gaze up from deep below.

The largest moon in the system, Muérai orbits the gas giant Hræth, which is positioned behind Kanyiirah’s orbit and matching it 1:1, holding a fixed position in the Kanyiiran sky. Strangely, it seems to drink in the vibrance of the Suhns, leaving Muérai perpetually dark and lit only by the eerie glow of Hræth above — and the occasional flicker of energy pulses that surge from its own depths. 

The boundary between the Ethereal, Mundane, and Beyond [[Planes of Existence|planes]] is all but nonexistent here, each bleeding into one another in unique ways that manifest labyrinthian mysteries only the bravest or maddest dare attempt to navigate. %%

This is the Gloam or "**Underworld**", the resting place of souls too weak or broken to anchor spirits. Ydi-Kaarin Souls are ushered to this world through its single entrance, called the **Gates of Silence**: a great structure built and guarded by loyal devotees of the Mother of Death, [[Entropy|Mykaedra]]

# Inhabitants
## lØ'ræ
(lew-RAH)
The descendants of the [[Yggrāhkærn]] Colossi that [[Yggrāhkærn#^9c44a6|followed Hæletec to Muérai]].
Led by the N'ordn duchess [[Hæletec]] and her offspring, the Lö'ræ defend their cities from the abominations that live within the ever-creeping mists on Muérai's surface.

They are immensely powerful beings, having carved out a thriving — if continually threatened — civilization of sprawling underground kingdoms.
