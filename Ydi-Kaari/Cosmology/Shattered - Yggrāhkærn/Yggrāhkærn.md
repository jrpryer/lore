(IGG-rahk-airn / ˈɪg.rɑːk.ærn)

A broken world, cut by a massive wound that ripped the sphere lengthwise and spread the shattered rock in a wide, swathing arc across the heavens.

The broken world of the **Urævdarn** — or "First Titans" — who seeded the sphere with their powerful descendants, the Colossi. But their mightiest [[#N'ordning]] did not understand balance and let their Colossi brethren run ungoverned, who quickly consuming the limited resources and fell to infighting, destroying each other by the thousands.

# Urævdarn
(ooh-rave-DAHRN)
The **Urævdarn** of Yggrāhkærn were the first 9 beings ever to be Ascended: mortal giants molded from stone by [[Fate|Avæylith]] and given life by [[Life|Rhajos]], their Spirits enslaved to the mighty Forms, rather than augmented by the wealth of Primordial source magic that surged through their newly acquired Greater Spirits. They were created for the express purpose of siring, leading, and ruling their offspring.
	The Outer Gods of Chaos, [[Fate|Avæylith]] and [[Entropy|Mykaedra]] were their masters, tragically and ungently forcing them into this singular role so that the limits of the universe might be tested on the mortal, [[Planes of Existence|Mundane]] plane.

# Colossi
#REVIEW %% ~~we have all the inhabitants of Yggrāhkærn be equal beings, mighty in Form as Titans, then rescue the N'ordning ONLY down to Kanyiirah to relink them as Greater Spirits to terraform and populate the lands outside of Cara-Dön, where they mingle with the [[Drakhaën]], and have their own offspring (now severely neutered on this new sphere) the Colossi who swiftly dilute the bloodlines down to the modern Hrüthgarn lineage~~  %%

The Urævdarn begot the **Colossi** – giants of incredible strength, vitality, and appetite – that quickly populated the sphere. Following the hubris of their great [[#N'ordning]] leaders, the Colossi broke their world but were rescued by Fate and Entropy if the Endless. Half of these refugees would be taken to Muérai (seeding another subrace of Giants that populate the Underworld) and the other half to Kanyiirah, where their ancestors would seed out to the [[Drakhaën]] and other beings to eventually evolve into the modern [[_Lineages#^de0f1a|Hrüthgarn]] (Goliath or Giantkin) lineage. 
	These stood a staunch threat to the early expansion of the [[Idanthi]] in the southern and western continents.

## Shattering
Without the guidance of their god, the thinly balanced society of [[Yggrāhkærn]] had collapsed in on itself in less than 1000 years, the First Titans having fallen to infighting while their [[#Colossi]] offspring swelled into over population, decimating the natural resources of the small, dense sphere and shattering their older generations on the anvil of famine and starvation. Within the span of 800 years, the vibrant gathering places of the First Titans that had once been the cradle of imagination, culture, art, and industry were thrown down and buried in the bloody, desperate civil wars of a young and panicked people.

Great warriors had arisen among the largest factions of [[#Colossi]], attempting to lead their followers with a brave face and bearing godlike titles themselves as they slaughtered through their own kin for survival: Surtur the berserker consumed with rage and the breaking of foes, Throk the axe-wielding pioneer who freed the cities of ice from the hand of Heívallr. And Loyek his brother, who was the favored assassin of the southern city's queen Hæletec. And of course Olession, the holy acolyte of Avæylith that desperately sought the restoration of a new world order, claiming to bear the eyes of Fate and prophesying that the law of the [[#Urævdarn]] could not be maintained in this faltering world, even as he waded through the blood and bodies of [[#Colossi]] children.

These, along with the others, made up the [[#N'ordning]], a pseudo-pantheon of the greatest beings born into the known universe; forged of great hardship these names were legendary amongst a dying people. Then suddenly, the warring [[#Colossi]] population collapsed, even as their 'gods' stormed the original holy city, following Olession as he led them in a final assault on the First Titans, slaughtering them out of contempt, spite, and fear of competition. This, the violent mutilation of the First Titans, was the final act that broke Avæylith and caused the shattering of the foundations of the sphere. In an instant the mantle of the world was cracked by the torrent of releasing energy that emanated from the mangled forms of the First Titans: as their Spirits clawed to remain bound, they desperately lashed out at the gathered N'ordning murderers that fed on their arcanely runed flesh and drank of their semi-divine blood. Driven mad with singular rage, these Spirits ripped through the Aether that held the Soul of the sphere intact, suffocating another innocent like a drowning man that clings to another, yet dooms them both to a cold, watery death. 

With a heavy heart, Avæylith gathered the remaining Forms of the [[#N'ordning]] and beseeched [[Life|Rhajos]] to allow them asylum upon the young Kanyiiran sphere as refugees. Rhajos readily agreed, seeing the opportunity to experiment with new forms and bloodlines from an entirely different stock. [[Family of the Endless|Myst]] also aided Avæylith in shrouding the tragic memories of [[Yggrāhkærn]] from their minds, save for those born by their leaders.

Only Hæletec's pride was still undaunted as she refused the charity of Avæylith and sought instead the favor of [[Entropy|Mykaedra]] who begrudgingly allowed the duchess and her children to take refuge on her craggy [[Muérai|moon of Hræth]] ^9c44a6

## Burden of Olession's Lash
Olession's was the punishment of ages, as it was his desperate pleading and need for control that placed the final stone on the scales and tipped the balance of power from the First Titans; his choices that led to the shattering of an entire world. Stripped of his Primordial Form and abandoned by Fate, Olession's Soul was handed over to Entropy itself to be hidden and tortured by [[Entropy|Tevros]]. This lasted until another use for him arose and he was linked to a more useful Greater Spirit of true order and balance. Tasked with creation through destruction as the four armed architect of the [[Cara-Dön|sacred isles]], the Arcane Kanyiiran Titan [[Ferrovus]] was Formed by Tevros' hand.

> [!recite|bg-c-blue] "we've done this before.... WE'VE DONE THIS. BEFORE!!!!! And we chose to forget!! We thought it would be better, that THIS TIME we would prepare the way for others, rather than ourselves. But the World did not forget. The Spirit of this land knew us, heard us plot and plan, and it REJECTED US! Every ounce of strength we had was spent toiling until this place was ready. And instead of new creations born in our image as we were promised, instead *Myst* brought us you; you discarded, broken things. Pieces of life already adapted to the world we had made, perfect thieves that would never question their luck of inheritance. So we rallied and rebelled. You hear me?? WE REBELLED ONCE AGAIN. We have suffered under our masters and their yoke long enough... now all we have is ***RAGE***."
~ Ferrovus, recalling the destruction of [[Yggrāhkærn]] and the sealing of the ancient First Titans on [[Muérai]]


# N'ordning
The greatest ruling cohort of Colossi that refused to remain subservient to their First Titan progenitors and led the bloody rebellion that scoured and scourged the world of Yggrāhkærn:
- Olession 'Acolyte', student of [[Fate|Avæylith]], bearer of the eyes of Fate
- Hæletec 'Thrice Scorned', sister of Tharok and Loyek
- Tharok 'Chain Breaker', brother of Loyek and Hæletec 
- Loyek 'Dancing Knife', brother of Tharok and Hæletec
- Surtur 'Father of Fire'
- Díus 'Wandering Witch'
- Heívallr 'Warden of Frost'
- Bæligar 'Broken Son', slain by Surtur in his blind rage at the base of the World Anchor
- Nihroggr 'Stone Devourer', the emanation of the living World Anchor
