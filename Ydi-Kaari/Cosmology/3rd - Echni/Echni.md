# World Trees
The world of Echni — also called the Syrisi sphere to Kanyiiran astrologers — is unique in its composition, in that the entire surface is made up of impossibly massive forests and sweeping glens that speak to one another in their own way. Each tree connected to their neighbor by a series of interwoven root structures that tied together and leading back to one of two special origins: the World Trees of Greater and Lesser Echnica, **Dèndronaos** and **Nenèdrhiel**

Split between these two figureheads, the arbors live and breathe as two unique ecosystems enveloping the whole of the sphere, alternating between wakefulness and slumber depending on which World Tree is rotated towards the Suhns on any given day. It should be noted that the seasons of the sphere play a vital role in marking the fine balance of control shared by the two World Trees, with Spring and Summer cultivating the new growth and life found within Lesser Echnica, and Winter and Autumn empowering the natural resilience and vibrance found within Greater Ethnica.

# Greater Echnica
**Languages:** ? (the Divine Tongue of the [[Kanirûl Pantheon|Kanirûl]])

Greater Echnica is a continent on Echni, the verdant world touched by [[Family of the Endless|Myst of the Endless]]. It was a place where life was abundant and magic was woven into the very fabric of the Sphere's inhabitants, sometimes referred to as the lands of the Fae or of Faeries.

It was only after Myst was sealed away and the fusion of their Arcane World Tree with her Primordial power had settled into the souls of the king and his court that the bitter consequences of their actions become fully known to them. And so they fled, the queen removing all memories of their beloved home from each of them so they might start again somewhere new.

To its original inhabitants, Echni was known as a realm of dreams, where the fantasies of any creature could be realized. For the king of the Amber Dusk Court Solanas and his promised queen consort [[Lunatas]], that dream was of a unified land and large family. Unfortunately, Fate of the Endless had other plans...

# Lesser Echnica
While the World Tree of Greater Echnica sealed the form of Myst and burned, the World Tree of Lesser Echnica — called **Nenèdrhiel**  — still thrives, giving shade and shelter to the **Wild Fae**. These resolute and warlike littlings differ from their Greater court-bound cousins by their shorter, usually darker hair and long, colorful Faerie wings. Unique amongst them as well is the power of their **Hereditary Contracts** given to them by Myst. Wild Fae can spread their colorful wings to enjoy the gift of true flight, which allows them to take to the air and brave the currents above and below the great canopies. Mastery of the skill is held by the elite company of the Golden Backs.

In exchange for this concession, the Wild Fae are bound to uphold all written agreements they undersign with their name, as well as all those they inherit upon the death of their parents. Because of the great deference for family and for the elders of their Folk, ties such as these are often long standing, establishing the foundation upon which the Wild Fae society exists.

Planted by Myst of the Endless, **Nenèdrhiel** stands as the living heart of Lesser Echnica— a vast, verdant guardian whose branches shimmer with soft azure bioluminescence, reminiscent of star-strewn skies. The roots of Nenèdrhiel run as deeply as the pacts of the Wild Fae, anchoring both tree and Faerie in an unbreakable covenant of nature and magic. Such is the tree’s gift and the Fae’s oath — united in silent growth and steadfast devotion to a shared legacy.
