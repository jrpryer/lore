Led by their great **Khans**, the 8 tribes of the nomadic Tashi people make up a roving power structure that freely roam the riverbanks and steppes of the Carain heartland. These superstitious and unyielding clans of [[Alseid]] and [[Nagaji]] that inhabit the unconquered lands between the [[Ropeshian Dynasty|Dynastic]] and [[Carain Empire|Imperial]] borders pay tribute to the Tashi Khans and their mighty Alseid warbands for protection from the Imperial troops that harry them. 

Though they are not organized enough to be worth an all-out war from the Empire, they do raid enough of the border trade routes to stay on the emperor's short list, while also holding rich farm ground that the Ropeshians covet, keeping the tensions between their neighbors at a constant high.
