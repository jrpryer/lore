- Stories

The northern region of [[Cara]] is home to the stout-hearted people of the Carain Empire. They are stubborn, strong-willed, and perceptive folk, ruled by the wisdom of their Imperium and sages. The Empire is held together by its rich stories and even richer mines that both run deep within the [[Frostfire Peaks]] that make up over half of the Empire's territory. 
Real-world Russian and Scottish influences heavily inspire their vibe.

The dwarves of the Frostfire depths were the last speakers of the Lord Below, the Great Spirit sage that dwelt beneath [[Petyrgrad]] and has heavily influenced that culture. 

The people of the Empire have a history of keeping to themselves in all manners of life besides trade, in which they eagerly participate, exporting vast amounts of riches and minerals from their mines in exchange for the southern comforts of exotic food, clothing, and [[Mechanists]] tradespeople. They are shrewd merchants and bankers, as they manage the most valuable coinage in circulation among the sacred isles.

The second-largest Cara-Duhnian world power and main exporter of rare minerals, the Carain Empire has dug in its heels and erected its will upon the frozen north peaks of Cara. The smiths and craftsmen of the Empire are second to none in the world, though they maintain a keen sense of austere craftsmanship that aid in keeping the stability and value of their wealth and currency, keeping it beyond the volatile reach of the more fickle and shoddy luxuries of the southern nations.

As they share a border with the [[Vólatian Theocracy]], their artisan dedications tend to rotate [[University Towards Enlightened Truth|UTET]] students in tandem with the sponsorships of the Vólat Church. 

## History


# Current Status
#REVIEW 
They are a stern people, but welcoming to any outsiders that can brave their harsh winters. The dowager Tsarina Zhanna Saiksorin rules in the name of her sickly husband, the Tsar Veklon Saiksorin.

Zhanna is locked in a power struggle with her stepson, the crown prince Pyotr, as the ailing Tsar nears death. Pyotr surrounds himself with reformers and idealists, while Zhanna finds favor with the traditionist nobles and clergy. Meanwhile, the Empire's landed lords compete for glory in the ongoing border wars against the [[Tashi|Tashi]] raiders of the eastern steppes, all while eyeing the throne, should Pyotr fall before the Tsar dies, leaving the empress availible to search for a new consort. When the Chassurates from the Vólatian Theocracy first brought the news of the schism, Crown Prince Pyotr quickly embraced the reform and publicly claimed that the Carain happily renounced their ties to the heretical Vólat-sin ways and would embrace the new orthodoxy without struggle, sparking outrage from the clergy within the capital of Petyrgrad. Zhanna ruthlessly admonished that dissent but could not outright contradict Pyotr's decree. And though the people are eager for change, they are wary of instability and watch the conflict between the Crown Prince and his stepmother the Tsarina with bated breath. Note: Special minerals known as Divine Tearstones have only ever been found on the tallest ridges of the Frostpoint Peaks. One can be identified by the subtle change in snowflakes that fall near it, as they resemble small flower petals.
