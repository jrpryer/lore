An enigmatic and versatile culture that values work ethic, familial honor, personal growth, and martial prowess. Their wide, windswept foothills have been the proving ground for some of the greatest heroes ever seen in Cara-Duhnian history.


## History
An alliance of marriage between the two great family lineages of Ki’ju Rrop and Zintzu Pesh birthed the mighty and honor-bound nation of Ropesh. It was said that Zintzu Pesh was the offspring of [[Taerannon]] himself, her mother having caught the eye of The Untamed as an acolyte in the Silver Hills. She was a fair beauty of gentle spirit, promised in marriage to the great Pheonix-slayer himself.

Due to unforeseen illness of the blood though, the original Ropesh family quicky died out within 40 years. Desperate for leadership, the feudal lords and cousins of the Pesh line elected a new Ropeshian **Khagan**, or "honor-bearer" from their own ranks to assume the family title, and continue to pick from these noble houses every few generations to maintain order within the nation. During [[the Thinning]], the Ropeshian Dynasty floundered in seclusion under the feudal rule of Sir Mokoda Scottsdale I, who was himself a [[_Lineages#Post-Nashtaran Emergences|secret descendant]] of [[Fate of the Heartkindler|Rathus]].

# Current Status
Still prosperous, but fraying at the edges, the Ropeshians have readily adopted the new Volat-rah orthodoxy, though some traditionalists still cling to the outlawed Volat-sin beliefs in secret. Peasants face high taxes, labor shortages, and economic pressures from the [[Carain Empire]], so reform is gladly accepted among the masses.

The current ruler, Khagan Yamao Ropesh III, is a stern man who once crushed all dissents and rebels across his domains. Plots swirl in the golden-domed capital of [[Sungard]] as nobles vie for power and influence over the aged ruler. Though the Khagan rules absolutely from his gilded palace, he has grown distant and unconcerned by the plight of the peasants of his domain.

One of the Khagan's chief councilors, Vros Malo, handles many of the bureaucratic affairs of state now, growing rich off bribes and corruption of the lesser lords of the outer regions. He secretly plots to eliminate the Khagan's reckless heir Lako to seize power once Yamao dies. 

While the common folk work the vast Ropeshian fields and peasants see after the herds of livestock that graze the rolling southern hills, skilled engineers are currently constructing a new network of roads and irrigation canals across the kingdom. However, peasant revolts are on the rise, as the people are starting to feel the burden of an absent-minded Khagan.
