>[!recite|bg-c-gray] _Our beautiful satellite bodies have been with us since Nashtara, watching over us during the time of the gods and even now, after they have departed. Many cultures have entertained their own stories about the moons, though most are simply fantastical myths. Still, there is a great deal of mystery surrounding their effects on the sphere. For instance, the horizontal drift of Valya seems to somehow correlate with the seasons in exact ways that we are only just now discovering._

The [[Kanyiirah]] sphere is orbited by 2 moons:

# Roida
- A large, crimson moon called **<span style="color: #a33b42;font-weight: bold">Roida</span>** remains in the sky for about 3/4 of the night, passing overhead swiftly and transitioning his bright red-orange glow to a dull red hue before passing out of sight against the waters on the misty horizon.

# Valya
- A smaller but much brighter purple-white moon called <span style="color: #b591e4;font-weight: bold">Valya</span>. She can be seen dancing along her predictable path for 3 1/2 days before drifting back to the start, visible throughout the nights and even on some cloudless days.  

# History
#lore-doc 
Ancient tales passed down from the [[Aqualii]] ancestors speak of the arrival of the [[Kanirûl Pantheon|Middle Pantheon]] and how [[Lunatas]] stepped forth into Kanyiirah, carrying two bundles of cloth, unmoving. One particular legend tells of her first ascension into the night sky, seeking favor with the [[Fate|Mother of the Stars]], Asteria, hoping to return life to her lost children. Instead, she was accosted by [[Darkness|Vespera]], who sought to trick the grieving goddess into handing over her children for the Mother of Night to consume. The tale speaks of their discourse, how Lunatas blessed her children's bodies before handing them over to the Mother of Trickery, and how the wards protected them from Vespera's schemes. Vespera was herself deceived but was still honored-bound to fulfill Lunatas' wishes: that her children would be born anew to see the fledgling world blossom under their family's care. 
 And so, the tale goes that the late offspring of Lunatas and Solanas — Roida, the eldest and most willful, and Valya, the youngest and most fair — came to encircle the Kanyiirah Sphere as new moons, honoring the promise made by the Mother of Night and Trickery.

## Lunar Cycles
#REVIEW 
The two celestial bodies hold profound cultural, religious, and even scientific importance. Their movements and interactions are organized thus: 
Roida:
- Appearance and Size:
	Roida, the larger of the two moons, appears crimson-red as it transitions through the sky. Its glow shifts from bright red-orange at its zenith to a duller red as it approaches the horizon, mimicking the warmth of a setting sun.
- Cycle and Visibility:
	Roida completes one orbit every 28 days, aligning closely with a terrestrial month. It is visible for approximately three-quarters of each night, spending the last quarter below the horizon.
- Movement:
	Roida’s path is slower and more deliberate, reflecting her willful and steadfast personality in the myths. Her orbit slightly shifts over the years, which astronomers attribute to the influence of Valya’s pull.  
  
Valya:
- Appearance and Size:
	Valya, smaller but more luminous, shines with a purple-white brilliance. Her brightness allows her to be seen even during the day on clear occasions.
- Cycle and Visibility:
	Valya completes her orbit every 3.5 days, creating an intricate interplay of phases as she dances around Kanyiirah. Her movements are highly predictable, a symbol of her fair and constant nature.
- Movement:
	Valya’s faster orbit causes her to appear "dancing", relative to Roida’s steadier pace. Her orbit is slightly tilted, which causes her to drift horizontally over time, aligning with seasonal changes.  
  
Organized Lunar Phases and Interactions: 
Each moon has its own set of distinct phases, but their interactions create unique phenomena:

Roida:
- Red Dawn: Bright crimson glow as she rises above the horizon.
- Burning Zenith: Intense red-orange light at her highest point in the sky.
- Dying Ember: Fading dull red as she approaches the horizon.
- The Slumber: The dark period when Roida dips below the horizon, symbolizing a time of rest or endings.
Valya:
- Brilliant Glow: Fully visible and brightest during her peak phase.
- Veiled Moon: A pale, half-lit phase when she passes closest to Roida.
- Shadowed Dance: A brief eclipse-like moment when her light dims, often considered an ill omen or a time of great reflection.
  
  
Shared Lunar Events: 
The interaction of Roida and Valya creates unique celestial phenomena: 
- The Crimson Eclipse:
	Every 112 days (a multiple of Valya’s orbit aligning with Roida's slower cycle), Valya passes directly in front of Roida. The smaller moon’s purple-white glow cuts across the crimson light, creating a striking halo effect in the night sky. This event is considered a time of balance and transition, often observed with ceremonies honoring the bond between the moons. 
- The Twin Zenith:
	Roughly once per year, both moons reach their highest points in the sky simultaneously, creating a dazzling display of red and purple-white light. It is considered an auspicious event, often linked to fertility, creation, and renewal. 
- The Widow’s Gaze:
	Every 7 years, Roida and Valya align with a constellation associated with Asteria, the Widow, creating a "path of stars" between them. This event is considered sacred, symbolizing the fulfillment of Vespera’s promise and Lunatas' hope for her children.    
 
Scientific and Magical Implications: 
- Tides and Weather: 
The gravitational pull of both moons creates complex tidal patterns. Roida’s slower orbit causes longer tidal shifts, while Valya’s faster orbit generates smaller, more frequent tidal flows. This interplay also impacts seasonal weather, aligning Valya’s horizontal drift with equinoxes and solstices. 

Lunar Festivals and Rituals:
- Roida’s Crimson Harvest: 
	Celebrated during her peak zenith, focusing on endings, war, and protection.
- Valya’s Dancer’s Vigil: 
	Observed during her brightest period, focusing on hope, guidance, and rebirth.
- Twin Moon Revels: 
	When both moons align, communities hold celebrations that blend both moons’ aspects, often marked by dances, offerings, and storytelling.
  
  
 Cultural Integration: 
 Religious Symbolism:
 - Roida is often associated with passion, willpower, and endings, embodying a fiercer, protective side of Lunatas.
- Valya represents guidance, beauty, and beginnings, carrying Lunatas’ gentler, nurturing essence.

Astrological Significance: 
Astrologers chart the moons’ paths to predict events and understand personality traits. Those born under Roida’s light are seen as driven and intense, while those under Valya’s glow are considered creative and adaptable. 

Mythical Interpretations: 
Legends often see the moons’ movements as reflections of their sibling relationship. 

For example:
- When Valya passes closest to Roida, it is seen as the younger sister seeking comfort from her elder.
- During eclipses, myths say Roida shields Valya from unseen cosmic threats.
