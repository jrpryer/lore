Also called the Sacred Isles, the continent of Cara-Duhn is made up of several clusters of major and minor islands. It is named after the dual major isles, **[[Cara]]** and **[[Duhn]]**, the two largest land masses that hold the greatest concentration of resources and population. 
The region also contains the minor isles of **[[Evryn]]** and **[[Delipol]]**, as well as the [[Lesser Isles|lesser southern island chains]] of Isthar, Trilun, Cassala, and Prosperine. The lesser isle of Subasa also decorates the western coastline of Cara.

# Cara-Duhnian People
>[!recite|bg-c-gray] _After the Thinning, several groups found their numbers severely diminished, to the point where encountering them in today's age in almost a rarity. Though their pride runs deep and their memories long-lasting, you would be hard pressed to find any large communities of Nagaji, Urik, or Strix, and even less likely you'd encounter even just a handful of {redacted} or {redacted}._

Before all, were the [[Idanthi]] who occupied a region of southern Evryn before the menagerie of sapient races came stepped forth with the Middle Pantheon onto the bright shores of [[Delipol|the Deli]]. This new influx of life became known as [[Nashtara]]:

More species may have been present at the Birth but were too far flung for the Aqualii scholars to take a census. This marked the beginning of the Walking Gods era, as the the pantheon of [[Kanirûl Pantheon|Kanirûl]] gods led the people forth to populate the other isles. Unfortunately, many species did not have the space to thrive as they needed in the Cara-Duhn region. And for others, their needs were met tenfold, allowing their populations to boom. Thankfully, their shared history and religion brought them together in many ways, making the bonds of the nations that were in close proximity to one another quite strong for many generations. In the absence of the gods, however, such bonds were severely tested. And many broke.  
  
After the Departure, great wars began cropping up all around as new governments formed, defensive cities built, deadly weapons crafted, and fields sown. The forethought of the gods and variety of species that walked with them staved off any mass genocides. But the numbers of many people groups were severely diminished within Cara-Duhn. Although we refer to this as the Founding era, it is colloquially known as [[The Thinning]]
