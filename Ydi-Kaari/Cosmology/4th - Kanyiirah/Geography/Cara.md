(KAH-ruh / ˈkɑːrə)

The rugged, mountainous landscape of the north-most isle of the [[Cara-Duhn|Cara-Duhnian]] continent.

Being so far north, Cara has some of the best views of the Kanyiiran northern lights — ribbons of green and pink flowing in a river of pure [[Family of the Endless#Fracture|flux]].

# Inhabitants
The people groups that migrated and settled on the major isle are known for their heartiness, stubbornness, and ability to thrive under any conditions.

Amongst the population of the [[Ropeshian Dynasty]], one can find a general mix of [[Smallfolk#Halfling|Halfling Smallfolk]], [[Nagaji]], and [[Elvi]]. %% The highest congregation of [[Kitsune]] can also be found within the capital city of [[Sungard]]. %%

- Names amongst Ropeshian citizens typically follow the first-name second-name structure, though it is customary for the unlanded, lower-class Ropeshians to take their father's first name as their second name.
- Some common Ropeshian names would include: Lao Kiiec, Rola Wuyo, Pok Gao, and Clecé Bo #REVIEW

In contrast, the people of the [[Carain Empire]] are a mottled mix of [[Oread]], [[Strix]], [[Smallfolk#Gnome|Gnome Smallfolk]], and [[Hobgoblin]]. Most of the inhabitants of Cara's open plains in the south of the Empire are populated by Smallfolk farms and sparse Hobgoblin family holdings there as well. The occasional [[Urik]] clan can also be found roaming the lower hills.

- Carain names are just as varied as its ethnic wheel, though it is not uncommon for Imperial documents to pass through the hands of a Mithrani, Omalad, Tavithi, Unaval, or Malovor second-named.
- Dwarf clans make a clear distinction between their Oread or Ifrit heritages by adding either a '-ora' or '-fira' suffix to their first-names, respectively

The unconquered lands between the Dynastic and Imperial borders are inhabited by a stout and unyielding collection of [[Alseid]] centaur tribes ruled by the [[Tashi|Tashi Khans]]. Handfuls of [[Nagaji]], [[Elvi#Nox'eli|Nox'eli Elvi]], and [[Hobgoblin#Wilding|Hobgoblin Wilding]] nomads are found amongst the Tashi river clans.

Those who call the [[Vólatian Theocracy]] home are of every race, creed, family, and heritage, though [[Elvi]], [[Smallfolk#Halfling|Halfling Smallfolk]], and [[Strix]] provide the greatest share of the population. The [[University Towards Enlightened Truth|University]] boasts the most complete roster of faculty and higher learning professionals in the known world, its campus open to all who desire to serve society and the pursuit of knowledge. Within the Theocracy, titles are a more common identifier between individuals than names. If someone possesses a rank of education in the UTET, they will often self-identify by their year and dedication.
