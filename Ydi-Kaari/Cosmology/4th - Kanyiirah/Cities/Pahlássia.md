# Details
The great mercantile city-state of Pahlássia is a standalone natural hub of artistry, economics, and manufacturing. They are an unaffiliated party that partakes in the great trade between the other, more expansive nations of the sacred isles. 

Due in large part to their impenetrable natural defenses from the land they remain unconquered; though the [[House Taran|Tarani Houses]] have never stopped sending delegates to convince the ruling guild leaders to join their nation and accept the rule of a Tarani duke. And though the [[Silver Shores Consortium]] has recently gained a majority share in the labor markets of the ten-tiered city, Pahlássia remains strictly unaffiliated. Their only threat coming from the sea where they have erected an impressive system of canals and gates to limit waterborne traffic to their lucrative docks.
