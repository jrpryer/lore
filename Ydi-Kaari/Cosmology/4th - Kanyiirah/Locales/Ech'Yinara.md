(ech-yih-NAR-ah)

The central domain of the Kanirûl, containing their seat of judgement, tournament grounds, and individual shrines and living quarters. Though they spent most of their time among the people of their established kingdoms, the pantheon did often visit and reside in this acropolis. 

The Kaelitharion - the council chambers where only the [[Kanirûl Pantheon|Kanirûl]] have ever stepped foot. Sealed with unbreakable wards, the doors to The Kaelitharion have remained closed since the Departure.

# Architecture
Built by the hands of the walking gods themselves, Ech'Yinara drips with sweeping balconies, column-lined corridors, and towering ceilings. Stunning baroque artistry adorns nearly every interior while the exterior is dominated by perfectly smooth domes, convex-carved edges, and thin but vibrant foliage in the gardens. The divine substance [[Malovelium]] is used almost exclusively for the art and decorative installations that fill this campus of the gods.

# The Spellforge
Hidden beneath The Kaelitharion lies a massive anvil wrought of [[Malovelium]]. This was the workshop of [[Pyronia]], the place where she and [[Tympestyr]] devised their lesser Runes to tame the [[Anarûl Pantheon#Runes|Anarûl Runes]], and where she later forged the [[Runeblades]].
