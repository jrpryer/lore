%% #REVIEW  Rename to something more... fantastical? This is *the* premiere college of wisdom in the Sacred Isles... %%

Located upon the Subasa Isle, the University Towards Enlightened Truth — or **UTET** as it is colloquially referred — boasts the largest body of academic students and professional faculty of the sciences in all of Cara-Duhn. University scholars have recently made strides in optical magnification, medicinal prosthesis applications, and rune-enhanced synthetic compounds. 

# Dedications
Each member of the student body chooses a dedication in which to pursue their higher education. The longer one is enrolled in classes, the more research projects and scientific application opportunities they have access to.  Common dedications that have an enrollment tally over 500 students each, include:
- Mathematics
- Linguistics
- Philosophy
- Geology
- Alchemy
- Anthropology

Some dedications of a narrower scope and therefore smaller class enrollments include:
- Heurism
- Psychonics
- Cosmology
- Gravatonics
- Mutagenetics


# Higher Learning
> [!recite|bg-c-blue] "Understanding the ways of the gods is the primary purpose of science… through observation of the natural world, one sees the hidden unseen truths that were left behind from creation. What then, do the Kanirûl provide, in a world such as this? Where do we draw the line between observable, knowable activities that were set in motion by hands greater than any who walked among us, and the teachings of might immortals that sought our success in culture, society, and the arts? I do not claim that these are in opposition, but we *must* be clear and fair in our teachings if were are to produce a future of both knowledge and affluence. I seek to build a curriculum based on a foundation of philosophy and natural sciences, *then* introduce the distinct entry point of mortalkind in history so that my students may choose their path forward with clarity in their minds and truth in their hearts. Do not deny me this, I beg of you."

Arguments for a transition away from the Vólat church, after more scientific evidence of government systems became available and practiced at the UTET: 

“And primarily, what we have found is that religion is a social mechanism. It is a means of increasing prosociality so societies can grow larger and more complex, and there can be greater anonymity between members of a society without compromising their ability to cooperate and trust each other. Because that is a social framework that facilitates cooperation and trust through the performance of costly signaling, through rituals and other things that demonstrate to people you may not know that you are willing to tow the line and incur costs to put your fidelity to the social mores and standards on display.

So religion is very efficient at that, and that is why religion has persevered throughout history. But the research also shows that there are other social frameworks that can do that just as well and sometimes even more effectively. And particularly when those things are not entangled with things like Christian nationalism that create such divisions between in-groups and out-groups.”
