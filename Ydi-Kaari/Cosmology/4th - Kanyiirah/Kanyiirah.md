(can-YOY-ra / kæn’jɔɪ rɑː)

Kanyiirah is the 4th of 5 observable spheres that orbit the star system's binary Suhns and is the vibrant, life-giving heart of the Ydi-Kaari system. Orbited itself by [[Moons|two moons]]

It is the world that holds the sacred isles of [[Cara-Duhn]], the [[Eternal Maelstrom]], and many other lands yet unknown... there are a total of 5 continents on the sphere, with much of the world left undiscovered by the inhabitants of the Cara-Duhnian islands.

%% First terraformed by the 4 powerful entities that would become known as the Upper [[Anarûl Pantheon]]. After slamming into the surface of the sphere and surging through the fabric of its make, they calmed and began forming the ordering of the land, sea, and sky to their whim. They orbited the sphere like equidistant moons, pulling it into a new gravitational orbit about the Suhns to heat its frozen poles and cover the barren surface in its life-giving waters.
