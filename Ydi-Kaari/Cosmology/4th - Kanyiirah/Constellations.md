There are 8 major constellations in the Kanyiiran sky. They seem to migrate across the sky, due to the gently wobble of Kanyiirah around its binary solar parents, called the Suhns. When a single constellation drifts into alignment with cardinal North, it is said to have risen "in Majør" positioning. This is akin to the real-world mapping of astrological signs. These star patterns are quite important to several cultures within Kanyiirah, especially regarding spiritual matters of certain [[doctrines]].

[[Lämmrus|Lusturil]] is the celestial realm of radiance, a place of positive energy, suffused with light and restorative power. From the Kanyiirah sphere, glimmers of Lusturil can be seen, twinkling in Vespera's night sky. It is said that She jealously guards the pathways into Lusturil, ever since Asteria brought [[Caelaistra]] down from the heavens above and the Mother of Night saw the radiance of that realm for herself. Asteria still beckons the spirits of mortals towards the celestial plane, and it is said that the fulfillment of her prophecies will grant special favor with the Vólaril and might guarantee a seat in those Radiant Halls for eternity, as was discovered by [[Aethmi-Istar]].

Over time, legends and myths have swirled around the nature of Asteria's stars. Whether by revelation, superstition, or simple folklore, many constellations have been drawn and shared with the University for record and study. 

The constellations are as follows:  

# Solora's Hourglass 
Named after a great sage lost to legend, this constellation represents the ebb and flow of destiny and is said to rotate its position as if flipping over once a year. Its annual turning is said to mark opportunities for change and reinvention, heralding the beginning of summer.
  
# Artyom's Scales of Equity 
Forming a balanced scale, this constellation is in majør during the time of harvest. It serves as a celestial reminder of the importance of fairness and equality in society, serving as a special beacon to the oppressed in times of tyranny in the name of a mighty fighter.
  
# The Arrow of Falendrin 
Named after Falendrin, a mythical hunter who could shoot a single arrow along the crest of three mountain peaks and slay any type of beast. When this constellation rises in majør, people participate in archery and knife-throwing contests to test their skills. This constellation rises in the peak of Winter.
  
# The Eyes of Rhucryr 
This nine-tined diamond constellation marks the end of spring and is often associated with festivals celebrating the full bloom of life and the forgotten darkness of Winter. The paths of the two moons happen to also cross perfectly into the corner tines of the diamond twice in its majør.
  
# Harp of Theyton 
A man called Theyton was a legendary funeral minstrel whose stringed dirges were said to calm the wildest of monsters and grant solemnness to the grieving. When the winds grow cool and the Harp is in the sky, musical festivals are commonly held, and it's believed that funeral music played under its light has a special resonance.
  
# The Ship of Tylorin 
#REVIEW
This constellation recalls the tale of Captain Tylorin, who sailed to the end of the world to bring back a cure for a plague. When it appears on the horizon, people believe that great undertakings will succeed.
  
# The Tangled Serpent 
#REVIEW
According to folklore, this serpent ate its own tail in a fit of madness, turning itself into an eternal loop. It serves as a cautionary tale against self-destructive behavior and is often referenced in stories and parables.
  
# Whirlwind’s Eye 
#REVIEW
Resembling a spiraling wind, this constellation emerges during the stormy seasons, reminding people to take shelter and prepare for turbulent weather. It is during this season that the [[Eternal Maelstrom|Mists of Dolos]] are the thickest, whipped into a heavy fog by the Eternal Maelstrom.
