(LAHM-roos)

The celestial realm of the Greater Spirits that venerate The Echoing Radiance, [[Life|Xëk'Liën]]. Home to the pure Ilystrin, as well as the holy mortal-made-god [[Aethmi-Istar]] and his once-divine bride [[Valencia]].

Though they are rarely called upon to fight, the celestials of Lämmrus are ever watchful for threats to their unity, both inside and out, tolerating no risk to their figurehead, nor to the light of the Suhns which she empowers.
  
Also known to mortal kind as the Radiant Halls of **Lusturil**
Languages: [[Lustrálian]]

# Ilystrin Society
Liën rules Lämmrus with brilliant vision, maintaining a strict hierarchy of law and order across the entire Sphere through the [[Gilded Order]] centered in the brilliant capital city of [Loniel](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/406633/loniel-the-floating-city-of-angels-for-5e)

Ilystrin's are metallic in their physical forms, which they rarely adopt. They are Greater Spirits that exist primarily within the Harmonic layer of the [[Planes of Existence|Ethereal]] plane. 
Their society is organized within community Shells, resembling the structure of electrons that swirl about the nucleus of an atom. Their hierarchal government is also broken down into different representations of this same concept, with The Echoing Radiance acting as the center about which all things revolve.

Celestial Ilystrin are a proud race, secretive and greedy with their knowledge, though loyal to a fault to their hierarchy and orders.
