> [!recite|bg-c-gray] _Ours is a limited understanding of the natural phenomena that makes up the fabric of our reality. We know there are beings we call gods, capable of great feats of magic that have eluded mortalkind, colossal beings of strength and cunning that we barely understand. Yet these facts bring only more questions to bear, and so I pose a new suggestion: for the pursuits of this organization to put aside the histories told to us and seek instead to innovate on our own ability to observe the world we currently live in..._
  
> [!recite|bg-c-gray] _This sole focus on observational science will, I believe, be the true catalyst that catapults us all into a new era of enlightenment. And is that not the purpose upon which this very institution was founded?_

- Hræth | 6th from the Suhns, a purple/pink gas giant furthest from the Suhns. Notable is its terrestrial moon, [[Muérai]] - a bleak, craggy sphere, crisscrossed with massive ravines that cut into the surface like open wounds
- Comet belt | A gravitational anomaly that has captured a fair number of comets orbiting between Hræth and the Ydi-Kaari Suhns
- [[Yggrāhkærn|Olession's Lash]] | 5th from the Suhns, an astral debris field surrounding a cracked and broken sphere
- [[Kanyiirah]] | 4th from the Suhns 
	- Bursting with life and magic
	- Hosts two [[Moons]], Roida and Valya
	- 1.30 AU distance
- [[Echni|Syrisi]] | 3rd from the Suhns - a land of bright greenery and majestic floating islands
- [[Abythras|Saviurn]] | 2nd from the Suhns - a hardened land of volcanic stone, molten glass, and cavernous mountains
- [[Lämmrus|Lusturil]] | 1st from the Suhn - a horrendously windy, orange-yellow realm of discus spires and metallic rain


The Ydi-Kaari system is a small corner of a large globular star cluster, giving the skies of each world a bright, halo-like swathe of lights at night. The presence of Darkness, however, holds back a good majority of the piercing light from these neighboring stars, keeping the worlds bathed in a familiar shadow when the rotation of the spheres turn from the light of the two Suhns. The **Astral Expanse** separates the spheres, dividing the worlds from one another through vast distances of a cold vacuum.
