The adapted form of the [[Lustrálian]] language, spoken by the [[Drakhaën]] who originally fell from Lusturil. 

# Dialects
## Zholgath
Speakers: Drakhaën that followed the leadership of the [[Vaal'k|Vaal'kuhrea]] [[Zýrathar]]  
Etymology: From zhol (“sacred, holy”) + gath (“tongue, voice”)  
Meaning: "Sacred Tongue" – a dialect of divine reverence and spiritual authority.  
Phonetic Features:\
- Balanced syllables, with long vowels and soft consonants.

## Nirakthar
Speakers: Drakhaën that followed the leadership of the [[Vaal'k|Vaal'kuhrea]] [[Anílanthë]]
Etymology: From nirak (“shadow”) + thar (“threads, weavings”)  
Meaning: "Shadow Weavings" – referencing the fragmented yet connected threads of destiny this faction strives for.  
Phonetic Features:

# Evolution From Lustrálian
The natural language evolution influenced by the dragons' anatomy (serpentine lips, powerful throats) led to a more guttural, sharp phonology and a more complex syllable structure. Their culture emphasizes dominance, power, and arcane mastery, so their language adapted to reflect these priorities with commanding tones and new grammatical features.  

Draconic emphasizes strength and control. Ritualistic elements, such as the lengthened vowels and guttural ejectives, create an aura of power, particularly in spellcasting. The harsh phonological evolution mirrors the dragons’ environment and status as apex beings of earth and sky. The expanded verb aspect system also allows for precise control of time in their linguistic expression, important for arcane and ritualistic purposes. 

### Consonant Inventory 
(Additions and Changes)
**New Consonants**:
- Glottal: /χ/ (voiceless uvular fricative), /q/ (voiceless uvular stop)
- Ejective stops: /pʼ/, /tʼ/, /kʼ/ for added emphasis and force.
- Velar fricative: /ɣ/ (voiced counterpart to /x/).
  
**Modified Sounds**:
- /ʔ/ (glottal stop) becomes /q/ in many contexts.
- /s/ → /z/ in specific positions to emphasize arcane power.
- /ɾ/ (flap) hardens to /r/ (trill), reflecting a growling, more draconic tone.
  
### Vowel Inventory 
(Broader Spectrum) 
Draconic introduces vowel length distinctions for emphasis in magic and commands:
- Short vowels: /i, u, e, o, a/
- Long vowels: /iː, uː, eː, oː, aː/

### Syllable Structure: 
Expanded to **(CC)-C-V-(C)** 
Examples: _qra, klir, thron, skrâl._  

## Grammatical Evolution 
Word Order: **SOV** remains dominant, but **OSV** occasionally appears for emphasis, especially in rituals. 
Verb Aspects: Draconic verbs now feature new **aspect markers**:
**Perfective**: -_qa_ (completed action)
- e.g., _seraqa_ ("saw")

**Imperfective**: -_ruk_ (ongoing action)
- e.g., _seraruk_ ("is seeing")

**Habitual**: -_nak_ (repeated action)
- e.g., _sonanak_ ("often does")

**Intentional**: -_voth_ (will do)
- e.g., _karavoth_ ("will take")
 
### Nouns
Some nouns simplify or take on harsher endings for emphasis:
- _ōva_ ("thing") → _qra_
- _ālan_ ("person") → _drāl_ (associated with "dominator")
- _nara_ ("fire") → _thron_
- _ënda_ ("home") → _krûth_ ("lair")
